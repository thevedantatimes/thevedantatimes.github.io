---
May 2025 carried a familiar Catholic drama: silence, smoke, and a name spoken from the loggia. Yet the deeper drama is universal: how does spiritual authority renew itself without losing continuity, and how can a leader hold a tradition while serving a changing world. Vedanta treats such moments as mirrors for the inner life. When a crown changes hands, the Self remains; when offices shift, dharma still calls. We can read this election as a lesson in steadiness for all.

To speak Vedanta in a Christian context is not to flatten differences, but to illumine shared human questions: What is the source of compassion. What keeps power from hardening into domination. What makes service joyful instead of burdensome. The Upanishads answer with the vision of one Reality pervading all, and the Gita answers with karma yoga, action offered without grasping. In that light, a papal election becomes a meditation on humility, responsibility, and peace for the Church and the world.

## 1) A conclave as a spiritual symbol of change

Religions, like rivers, continue by changing. The river remains “the same” in name and form, yet water flows. A conclave is a public form of that flowing: one visible figure steps aside, another steps forward, and a community receives both loss and renewal at once. If we look only at the spectacle, we miss the teaching hidden inside it.

Vedanta begins with a quiet insistence: do not confuse the moving with the unmoving. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna points to the contrast between the changing body and the unchanging Self. A leadership office changes; a tradition evolves; a community’s needs shift. Yet the witness, the sakshi, is steady. When a civilization remembers this, transitions become less frantic, less tribal, and generally more humane.

A papal election, seen from Vedanta, is a moment when the world is invited to contemplate impermanence without despair. The Mandukya Upanishad speaks of waking, dream, and deep sleep, and then points beyond them to turiya, the “fourth,” the silent ground. In a similar way, public life has states: certainty, uncertainty, reorganization. Under them is a deeper continuity: the human longing for meaning, mercy, and peace.

Vedanta does not require us to agree on theology to learn from a symbolic moment. It asks only that we be honest about the mind’s movements: fear of the unknown, attachment to familiar patterns, hope for renewal, and the desire for a leader who will protect what is precious. These are universal. The question is how to hold them without being ruled by them.

A short Upanishadic phrase becomes a lamp here:

> “Neti, neti.”  
> “Not this, not this.” (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, method of negation)

Neti, neti does not deny the world; it denies the mind’s habit of clinging to partial identities as ultimate. A conclave reminds us that names and roles, however revered, are not the final ground. Leadership matters, but leadership is not the Absolute. This does not reduce leadership. It purifies our relationship to it.

## 2) What Vedanta calls “dharma” in public leadership

Dharma is often translated as duty, but it is broader: that which upholds, harmonizes, and steadies life. Dharma is the moral architecture beneath all institutions. Without dharma, laws become tricks and power becomes predation. With dharma, even imperfect systems can serve the common good.

A leader in any tradition is, at best, a steward of dharma. In a Catholic idiom, this stewardship is pastoral. In Vedanta, it is a form of karma yoga: action performed as service, not as ego. The practical question is the same: how does a leader keep the institution aligned with its deepest purpose.

The Gita gives a direct civic teaching:

> “Whatever the leader does, others follow.” (Gita 3.21, paraphrase)

This is not celebrity. It is causality. A leader’s tone, priorities, and inner posture cascade through the organization and into society. If a leader is reactive, institutions become reactive. If a leader is humble, institutions generally become more teachable. If a leader is attached to applause, institutions become performative. If a leader is rooted in truth, institutions have a chance to regain coherence.

Vedanta emphasizes that dharma is not enforced by anger, but by clarity. Anger may win a moment; clarity sustains a generation. In the Katha Upanishad, Yama speaks of two paths, the pleasant and the good:

> “The good is one thing; the pleasant is another.” (Katha Upanishad, condensed)

A dharmic leader chooses the good even when it is unpleasant. This is especially relevant in religious leadership because spiritual institutions carry both ideals and history. They carry beauty and also wounds. A leader who is willing to face wounds without losing love is practicing dharma at a high level.

In modern public debate, leadership is often reduced to ideology. Vedanta suggests a deeper lens: guna. Is leadership primarily sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic.

- **Sattva**: clarity, calm strength, transparency, and compassion.
- **Rajas**: ambition, speed, conflict, and restless performance.
- **Tamas**: denial, inertia, and moral fog.

Every leader contains all three. The art is to cultivate sattva and restrain rajas and tamas. A papal election is, among other things, a community’s hope for more sattva.

## 3) Karma yoga: the heart of ethical authority

Karma yoga is one of Vedanta’s central offerings to the modern world because it answers a practical problem: how to act intensely without being consumed by the fruits of action. Leadership always produces fruits: praise, blame, narratives, controversy, and conflict. A leader who clings to fruits becomes brittle. A leader who offers action into a higher purpose becomes resilient.

The Gita’s famous teaching is simple and severe:

> “You have the right to action, not to the fruits of action.” (Gita 2.47, common translation)

This does not mean outcomes do not matter. Outcomes matter deeply. It means the ego’s thirst to possess outcomes distorts action. When a leader acts primarily to be seen as holy, strong, or progressive, action bends toward image. When a leader acts primarily to protect an institution’s reputation, truth is sacrificed. Karma yoga asks the leader to renounce these distortions.

A Vedantic reading of spiritual authority therefore highlights three practices:

### 3.1) Offering action (īśvara-arpana)

The leader silently offers every action to the Divine, however conceived. This removes the need to use people as mirrors for ego. It also reduces the hidden violence of leadership: manipulating narratives to preserve status.

A short mantra from the Isha Upanishad supports this offering spirit:

> “Tena tyaktena bhunjitha.”  
> “Enjoy through renunciation.” (Isha Upanishad, condensed)

Renunciation here is not abandoning responsibility. It is renouncing possessiveness.

### 3.2) Accepting results (prasāda-buddhi)

After action is offered, results are received as prasada, as something to be met with humility, whether pleasant or unpleasant. This helps a leader remain steady under both praise and attack. It also prevents a leader from becoming addicted to quick wins that erode long term trust.

### 3.3) Acting for loka-sangraha

Krishna speaks of action performed for the holding together of the world:

> “Act for the welfare and stability of the world.” (Gita 3.20, paraphrase)

Religious leadership is not only internal governance. It also shapes social imagination: how people think about dignity, the poor, migrants, ecology, violence, forgiveness, and hope. A leader practicing loka-sangraha will generally prioritize what preserves human dignity over what merely expands influence.

From this Vedantic angle, the most important question after any election is not “Who won.” The deeper question is “What kind of mind will now serve.” A mind trained in karma yoga becomes a servant without self-erasure and a leader without domination.

## 4) Strength and gentleness: why “Leo” can be read Vedantically

Names in religious history often carry symbolic intention. “Leo” evokes lion-like courage and also echoes a memory of strong social teaching in Catholic history. Vedanta has its own relationship to strength. It does not glorify aggression. It glorifies fearlessness rooted in truth.

The Upanishads repeatedly associate liberation with fearlessness:

> “From the knowledge of Brahman comes fearlessness.” (Upanishadic theme, widely cited)

Fearlessness is not bravado. It is the quiet confidence of one who is not defined by gain and loss. In leadership, fearlessness looks like:

- speaking truth without cruelty,
- taking responsibility without defensiveness,
- acknowledging limits without collapse,
- refusing to weaponize the sacred for politics.

The lion in Vedanta is not the predator. It is the awakened person who will not be bullied by ignorance. In the Vivekachudamani, Shankara compares the teacher’s instruction to a medicine that removes delusion. The lion’s roar is that instruction, not violence.

If “Leo” signifies courage, Vedanta asks: courage for what.

- Courage to reform where harm persists.
- Courage to protect the vulnerable even when the powerful complain.
- Courage to simplify complexity without lying.
- Courage to foster unity without erasing differences.

True strength, in Vedanta, is the strength to remain sattvic under pressure.

## 5) The nondual vision and the temptation of tribal identity

The modern world is thirsty for identity. Identity can be healing, giving belonging. Identity can also become a prison, turning communities into fortified tribes. A religious leader today must navigate this tension continuously.

Vedanta’s nondual teaching is a medicine against the poison of absolute tribalism. It does not abolish tradition; it abolishes hatred. It says: honor your path without declaring the other as less real.

A short and luminous statement from the Chandogya Upanishad points to unity:

> “Tat tvam asi.”  
> “That thou art.” (Chandogya Upanishad)

This does not mean “all ideas are the same.” It means the deepest Self is not divided. When that becomes lived, compassion becomes more natural and cruelty becomes harder to justify.

A papal election is watched worldwide, not only by Catholics. People project hopes and fears onto the new leader: hopes of peace, fears of rigidity, hopes of reform, fears of confusion. In Vedanta, projection is recognized as a mental movement: we see our own inner drama reflected in public events. The antidote is discrimination, viveka.

Viveka asks:

- What do I actually know.
- What am I merely assuming.
- What is my fear speaking.
- What is my love asking.

When we apply viveka, we can engage religious news without becoming enslaved by reaction.

## 6) Sannyasa and vows: leadership as a life of restraint

Vedanta honors renunciation, but not as escapism. Sannyasa, in its mature form, is renunciation of ego possession, not renunciation of love. In many monastic traditions, vows are a training in restraint: poverty, chastity, obedience, simplicity. These vows, when lived well, are a practical purification of greed and domination.

Vedanta often speaks of the inner renunciate: one who may live in the world while not being owned by it. The Gita expresses this with an image of the lotus:

> “He acts, but remains unattached, like a lotus untouched by water.” (Gita 5.10, paraphrase)

Leadership in a global religious institution invites constant temptations:

- the temptation to control narratives,
- the temptation to protect friends,
- the temptation to centralize power,
- the temptation to treat criticism as betrayal.

Vows, when taken seriously, are a counterweight. They remind the leader: you are not here to win. You are here to serve. Vedanta adds: serve without the ego of being the servant.

This is subtle. Ego can hide even in humility. A person can become proud of being humble. Vedanta calls for a humility that is almost impersonal, arising from the knowledge that the doer is not the ultimate doer.

## 7) Truth, justice, and purification: a Vedantic reading of institutional suffering

Every spiritual institution carries human history. Human history includes failure. When failures are denied, tamas grows. When failures are faced with truth and compassion, sattva grows.

Vedanta speaks of purification, chitta-shuddhi, as a necessary foundation for knowledge. Without purification, even lofty philosophy becomes a mask. Purification in a community involves:

- confession without spectacle,
- restitution where possible,
- transparent processes,
- protection for the vulnerable,
- accountability for the powerful.

The Mundaka Upanishad gives a sharp contrast between superficial knowledge and liberating knowledge. It distinguishes the “lower” knowledge of words and rites from the “higher” knowledge of the Imperishable. The lesson is not that rites are useless. The lesson is that rites without truth become hollow.

A leader stepping into office inherits not only visions, but unresolved pain. Vedanta would advise:

1. Do not minimize pain.
2. Do not weaponize pain.
3. Do not become paralyzed by pain.
4. Respond with dharma: clear principles and steady action.

This is karma yoga again, applied to institutional healing.

## 8) Compassion without sentimentality: what ahimsa looks like in governance

Ahimsa is often translated as nonviolence. In public leadership, it is the refusal to sacrifice persons for systems. It is also the refusal to treat suffering as an externality.

Ahimsa is not soft. It can be fierce in protecting the vulnerable. The Mahabharata and many dharmic texts show that nonviolence does not mean the absence of boundaries. It means boundaries without hatred.

A leader guided by ahimsa will usually:

- listen before deciding,
- speak with care, avoiding scapegoating,
- design processes that protect the least powerful,
- resist turning enemies into caricatures.

In Vedanta, compassion flows naturally from the vision of unity. When unity is intellectual, compassion becomes ethical effort. When unity is lived, compassion becomes spontaneous.

A helpful Vedantic prayer can be offered here:

> “Sarve bhavantu sukhinah.”  
> “May all be happy.”

It is simple, but it carries a radical demand: let decisions be measured by how they affect real lives, not only reputations.

## 9) The leader as “witness”: sakshi-bhava for public life

One of Vedanta’s most powerful tools is sakshi-bhava, the stance of the witness. The witness is not cold. It is clear. It observes thoughts, emotions, and impulses without instantly obeying them. For leaders, sakshi-bhava is indispensable because leadership invites storms.

Consider the daily conditions of a global spiritual leader:

- constant interpretation of words,
- competing demands from factions,
- geopolitical pressures,
- crises that erupt without warning,
- symbolic expectations impossible to satisfy.

Without sakshi-bhava, a leader becomes reactive. With sakshi-bhava, a leader can pause, see the mind’s movement, and then respond.

The Kena Upanishad points to the mystery behind the mind:

> “That which cannot be thought by the mind, but by which the mind is thought.” (Kena Upanishad, paraphrase)

This is not poetry alone. It is a practical invitation: stand back from thought, and you will act more wisely. A leader who can stand back from the flood of praise and blame can keep decisions aligned with dharma.

Sakshi-bhava also helps communities. When people watch an election, they often swing between idealization and disappointment. The witness stance allows admiration without idolatry and critique without contempt.

## 10) The Church, the world, and the Vedantic idea of “one family”

A phrase often used in Indian spiritual culture is “Vasudhaiva kutumbakam,” the world is one family. Even if one does not adopt it as doctrine, one can adopt it as an ethical horizon.

In a fractured world, religious leadership is often asked to be a bridge. Bridges do not erase rivers. They allow crossing. Vedanta encourages bridge building because it recognizes that behind diverse forms, the human heart longs for the same essentials: meaning, belonging, love, and release from fear.

The nondual vision does not require uniformity. It requires reverence for the other as a manifestation of the same Reality. When this reverence enters public discourse, the temperature lowers. Dialogue becomes possible.

A leader can model this by:

- speaking of opponents without contempt,
- honoring conscience,
- protecting minorities within the community,
- encouraging service across boundaries.

Vedanta’s “unity” is not vague. It is operational: if you and I share the same ground of being, then your suffering matters as my own.

## 11) Reading history through Vedanta: continuity without clinging

Vedanta does not ask us to despise tradition. It asks us to see tradition as a vehicle, not an idol. Vehicles must be maintained and sometimes repaired. If we worship the vehicle, we stop traveling.

Religious history is full of reform movements that tried to purify and renew. Vedanta’s counsel is: keep the essence, adjust the expression. The essence is always the movement from ignorance to knowledge, from ego to service, from fear to peace.

The Isha Upanishad balances two impulses:

- the call to act in the world,
- the call to know the Self.

It suggests that both can be held together. In similar fashion, leadership must hold:

- contemplation and administration,
- prayer and policy,
- mercy and justice,
- tradition and adaptation.

The stress of leadership often comes from trying to choose one side of a polarity. Vedanta suggests a deeper integration: act from stillness.

## 12) A Vedantic “rule of life” for leaders and communities

A papal election invites many to ask: what should change now. Vedanta gently shifts the question: what should deepen now. Change without depth becomes fashion. Depth without change becomes stagnation.

Here is a Vedanta-inspired rule of life, not as command, but as practice.

### 12.1) Daily discernment (viveka)

Ask each day:

- What is truly important.
- What is urgent but not important.
- What is fear-driven.
- What is love-driven.

Viveka is the compass.

### 12.2) Daily offering (karma yoga)

Before work: “May this action be for the welfare of all.”  
After work: “May I receive the result with humility.”

### 12.3) Daily inner silence (dhyana)

Even ten minutes of quiet reveals hidden rajas and tamas. Silence is not empty. It is cleansing.

A classical instruction is:

> “Be still, and know.” (Shared contemplative theme across traditions)

In Vedanta, stillness is the doorway to the Self.

### 12.4) Daily compassion in speech (ahimsa)

Speech can heal or harm. A leader’s speech sets a culture. Communities can adopt a vow: no unnecessary harshness, no gossip, no performative outrage.

### 12.5) Weekly service (seva)

Service keeps philosophy honest. Without seva, spirituality becomes a mirror for ego.

### 12.6) Monthly self-audit (chitta-shuddhi)

Ask:

- Where did I act from pride.
- Where did I hide truth.
- Where did I treat someone as an obstacle.
- Where did I choose the pleasant over the good.

Then offer correction without self-hatred. Vedanta is firm, but it is generally compassionate.

## 13) The universal prayer beneath every election: peace

Whatever one’s religion, peace is the common longing. Vedanta closes many teachings with shanti, peace invoked three times, often understood as peace in three domains: within, around, and beyond.

> “Om shanti, shanti, shanti.”

A new leader stepping forward, in any sacred tradition, often calls for peace. Vedanta hears this as more than diplomacy. It hears it as sadhana. Peace is not only an outcome. Peace is a way of being that reshapes outcomes.

If peace becomes real in the leader’s mind, decisions tend to become clearer. If peace becomes real in communities, conflicts become less destructive. If peace becomes real in institutions, reform becomes possible without war.

Vedanta therefore offers a gentle conclusion: let the world witness leadership transitions as reminders of the deeper transition available to every person. The outer chair changes. The inner possibility remains. We can move from ego to service, from confusion to clarity, from fear to love.

May the election of Pope Leo XIV in May 2025 be received, through a Vedantic lens, as an invitation to steadiness: dharma without rigidity, compassion without sentimentality, courage without hostility, and truth without cruelty.

Om tat sat.
