snippet: "Spirituality eases crisis by reducing mental suffering through knowledge, devotion, focused meditation, and compassionate service."
---
“Lead us from the unreal to the real.  
Lead us from darkness unto light.  
Lead us from death to immortality.”

These ancient words—soft as a prayer and sharp as a request—feel especially urgent when the world is shaking. In ordinary times, spirituality can seem like a luxury: something to read about, admire, or practice when the schedule is calm and the mind is cooperative. But a crisis has a way of stripping life down to essentials. It interrupts routines, removes the illusion of control, and forces the most human questions to the surface: *How do I live with uncertainty? How do I cope with fear? What do I do when the world feels unsafe and the mind won’t settle?*

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people everywhere asked these questions at once. In places like New York, where sirens cut through empty streets and hospitals became front lines, the suffering was visible and immediate. Yet even outside hospital walls, another kind of suffering spread: anxiety, loneliness, economic insecurity, the pressure of confinement, and the mental heaviness that turns each day into a climb.

In such moments, spiritual life is not meant to be decorative. It is meant to be functional—protective, steadying, and deeply practical. The Bhagavad Gita itself is a reminder: the highest spiritual teaching did not arise in a retreat, but on a battlefield, in the middle of a breakdown. The setting matters. It tells us something important: real spirituality is designed for the middle of real life, when the ground is moving.

So what can spiritual practice do in a crisis? It cannot magically erase the external problem. But it can transform how we carry it. And that difference changes everything.

## The Buddha’s two arrows: why we suffer twice

One of the most clarifying teachings comes from the Buddha, who described suffering through the image of two arrows.

The first arrow is what life throws at us: illness, loss, disruption, pain—events we did not choose. In a pandemic, the first arrow includes the virus itself, the consequences it triggers, and the unavoidable uncertainty it brings.

Then comes the second arrow: our internal reaction. Worry multiplies into panic. Uncertainty hardens into dread. Sadness becomes despair. The mind begins to replay frightening scenarios, rehearse catastrophes, and interpret every piece of news as a personal threat. The second arrow is not the event; it is the mental suffering layered on top of the event.

The first arrow must be handled with practical intelligence—medicine, public health measures, responsible behavior, common sense, and compassion. Spirituality does not replace those. But spiritual practice has a special power: it can address the second arrow. It can reduce the added suffering created by the mind’s habitual reactions. And in many cases, that second arrow is where most of our pain actually lives.

Vedanta offers several approaches, but four stand out as especially helpful in a time of crisis. Together they form a complete inner toolkit: knowledge, devotion, meditative focus, and service.

## 1) The path of knowledge: discovering the unshaken awareness

The first practice is the way of knowledge—*jnana*—especially as taught in Advaita Vedanta. At first glance it can seem abstract, even philosophical. But in a crisis, it reveals itself as intensely practical.

Start with a simple observation. Before the crisis, the mind was filled with ordinary concerns: work deadlines, family plans, small irritations, small pleasures. Then suddenly everything changed—“utterly changed,” as the poet Yeats wrote about another era of upheaval. The world looked different, felt different, moved different. People began describing life as “surreal,” almost dreamlike.

Now notice something subtle but decisive: all of this—ordinary life and disrupted life—appears in the same awareness.

The awareness that knew the busy streets is the same awareness that now knows the empty streets. The awareness that knew routine is the same awareness that knows instability. The awareness is constant; the experiences are changing.

Advaita asks: *Is that awareness itself harmed by what is happening?*

The virus affects the body. Anxiety affects the mind. But awareness is that which knows both body and mind. It is not identical to either. The body appears in awareness as sensation and perception. The mind appears in awareness as thought, emotion, memory, and fear. Those appearances shift, often dramatically. But the knowing presence—the capacity to witness—remains.

A direct test makes this clear: you are aware of a mind that is calm, and you are aware of a mind that is anxious. If awareness can illuminate both states, awareness is not trapped inside either state. The state comes and goes; the knower remains.

This is not a denial of pain. It is a relocation of identity. Instead of saying, “I am anxiety,” we learn to see, “Anxiety is an experience in me.” That single shift reduces the second arrow’s sting.

### The ocean and the wave: a bigger identity

Advaita often uses vast metaphors to expand our sense of self. One such image comes from the Ashtavakra Gita: consciousness is like an infinite ocean. Our lives and the world are like movements within it.

At first, we may imagine our life as a small boat tossed around on a huge ocean. The boat rises and falls—sometimes things go well, sometimes they do not. The crisis arrives like a storm. Yet the ocean itself is not anxious about the boat. It has an immense patience. It does not panic when the surface gets rough.

Then the teaching goes deeper. The world is not merely a boat *on* the ocean; it is more like a wave *in* the ocean. The wave rises and subsides, but the ocean does not become “more ocean” when the wave rises, nor “less ocean” when it falls. Nothing is truly added; nothing is truly removed. The forms change; the reality remains.

And deeper still: the world is described as appearance—an imagination, a projection—within the stillness of awareness. This is not meant as a casual dismissal of reality, but as a radical invitation to step back from the mind’s insistence that what is happening is the whole story.

From this standpoint, the crisis is real at the level of experience and responsibility, but it is not ultimate at the level of identity. Your deepest self is not the trembling surface. Your deepest self is the vastness in which trembling occurs.

### “Is this really the time for Advaita?”

Many people think nondual inquiry is only for peaceful days. Yet the logic is backwards. You do not go near fire after you are warm; you go near fire because you are cold. You do not wait for the ocean to become perfectly still before learning to swim; you learn because the waves are here.

A crisis is not a reason to postpone inner work. It is a reason to use it.

And this is what makes Advaita practical: it does not promise that external conditions will always cooperate. It promises that your essence is not dependent on those conditions. When deeply felt, this brings strength, clarity, and a kind of quiet joy that can exist even in hard times.

## 2) The path of devotion: “Not I, but Thou”

The second practice moves in the opposite direction. If knowledge says, “I am that infinite reality,” devotion says, “I am held by that infinite reality.”

There is a humility in devotion that becomes especially healing when the world reminds us how limited our control is. A tiny invisible virus can rearrange global life in weeks. Technology and wealth do not guarantee security. We are forced to admit what we usually hide: our vulnerability.

Devotion does not deny vulnerability. It gives vulnerability a home.

The devotional stance is simple: there is a vast power—call it God, Ishwara, the Divine Mother, the Lord—through whose order the universe moves. And that power, though often mysterious, is ultimately benevolent. We may not understand the pattern. We may not like the timing. But we can trust the intelligence behind it.

A beautiful line from the Narada Bhakti Sutras summarizes the spirit: worship the Lord at all times, in all ways, free from anxiety. The instruction is striking because it links devotion with freedom from worry. Not because worry is sinful, but because worry burns us alive.

An old verse compares anxiety (*chinta*) to a funeral pyre (*chita*). The pyre burns the dead, but anxiety burns the living. Devotion offers an alternative fire: not the fire of worry, but the fire of love and surrender.

### How to practice devotion when the mind won’t cooperate

Many people hear “think of God always” and feel defeated instantly. The mind is noisy. News cycles are loud. The body is tired. The future feels uncertain.

Vedanta suggests a practical method: bind the mind by **time, space, and object**.

- **Time:** “For the next 15 minutes, I will turn toward God.”  
- **Space:** “In this corner of the room, I will not entertain other concerns.”  
- **Object:** “This mantra, this form, this name—this is where the mind will rest.”

The mind cannot think without some structure. It requires an “anchor.” Time, space, and object are not God, but they help the mind approach God.

Even if thoughts intrude, the practice is to return—gently but firmly. Over time, the mind learns a new habit: instead of being bombarded by fear-inducing inputs, it becomes saturated with remembrance, gratitude, surrender, and love.

### Devotion expands beyond prayer into relationships

Devotion also has a broader meaning: the Divine is present in all beings. When circumstances force families into close quarters—crowded apartments, disrupted schedules, constant proximity—the situation can feel like a burden. But devotion reframes it as a field of worship.

Cooking, cleaning, helping children learn, offering patience, speaking kindly, encouraging someone online—these can become spiritual acts when done as service to the Divine present in others.

Just as panic is contagious, so is calm. Just as fear spreads quickly, so does hope. A small kindness can travel farther than we imagine.

## 3) Patanjali’s secret: one thought at a time

The third practice is a lesson from Patanjali’s yoga psychology. People often assume that controlling the mind requires heroic willpower. But Patanjali points to a simpler mechanism: the mind can hold **only one thought at a time** in a given instant.

Anxiety feels endless because it arrives as a stream. But it is always built from single moments. If we take responsibility for the mind one moment at a time, the task becomes possible.

The key is not to control the whole future of your mind. The key is to guide the next thought.

This is where the famous “one thing at a time” becomes more than a slogan. It becomes a technique for inner stability. At this moment, what is needed? What can I do? If nothing can be done right now, what is the best possible thought to hold?

For a spiritual practitioner, the best thought is often a mantra, a prayer, a verse, a song, or a remembrance of the Divine. Direct the next vritti toward that. Then do it again. Then again.

Over time, the mind “takes color” from what it repeatedly touches—like cloth absorbing dye. If it is dipped into worry, it becomes gloomy. If it is dipped into the remembrance of the Divine, it becomes luminous.

### The serenity prayer as applied Vedanta

A prayer often used in the West expresses a deeply yogic wisdom: courage to change what can be changed, patience to accept what cannot, and wisdom to know the difference.

This simple discrimination immediately reduces suffering. Much anxiety comes from trying to control what cannot be controlled. When you stop that futile struggle, energy is freed. That energy can then be applied to what you *can* do—practical action, disciplined routine, prayer, service, and kindness.

Moment by moment, thought by thought, the mind becomes less like a storm and more like a steady lamp.

## 4) The path of service: peace inside, usefulness outside

The fourth practice may be the most immediately uplifting: shift attention from personal fear to the welfare of others.

A powerful definition of spirituality captures it well: when I close my eyes, I find peace within; when I open my eyes, I ask, “What can I do for you?”

This is not sentimental. It is psychological and spiritual medicine. Anxiety is often self-referential. It circles around “me”: my safety, my future, my losses. Service breaks the loop.

When your intention becomes contribution—helping family, supporting colleagues, encouraging a friend, volunteering in safe ways, donating, checking on neighbors, sharing reliable information instead of panic—the mind gains purpose. Purpose is a natural antidote to depression.

Service does not require grand gestures. In many crises, the most heroic work is done by doctors, nurses, and essential workers. But not everyone will serve in that way. Still, everyone can serve somehow: with patience, with generosity, with listening, with small acts of care.

And here is the paradox: when we genuinely care for others, we discover a quiet confidence within ourselves. Fear loses some of its grip. The second arrow becomes blunt.

## Putting the four together: a complete response to crisis

These four practices are not competing philosophies. They are complementary tools. You can use all of them, even in the same day.

1. **Knowledge:** Remember the unchanging awareness—*I am not the storm; I am the sky in which storms appear.*  
2. **Devotion:** Surrender to a benevolent power—*Not my will alone; Thy will. Hold me.*  
3. **Meditative focus:** Train the mind one instant at a time—*This next thought belongs to prayer, mantra, or clarity.*  
4. **Service:** Turn outward with compassion—*How can I help, even a little?*

Notice how complete this is. Knowledge gives inner freedom. Devotion gives emotional refuge. Meditation gives mental method. Service gives ethical purpose.

Together, they address fear at every level.

## The goal is not denial—it is inner leadership

A spiritual response to crisis is not pretending everything is fine. It is not avoiding news, ignoring suffering, or bypassing grief. It is learning inner leadership: meeting reality while protecting the mind from unnecessary torment.

The first arrow must be handled responsibly. But the second arrow is optional. We do not have to shoot ourselves with it again and again.

Spirituality is meant to make us more sane, more compassionate, more resilient. It is meant to give light when circumstances feel dark. It is meant to give steadiness when the world feels unsteady.

And it is meant, above all, to return us to the deepest truth: that beneath changing conditions, there is an unshaken reality—whether you call it pure consciousness, the Divine presence, or the Lord who quietly holds the universe together.

May that reality be our refuge.  
May it bless our families and communities.  
May it protect all who suffer.  
May it give strength to those who serve on the front lines.  
And may it guide each of us from fear to clarity, from darkness to light, and from the burden of anxiety to the freedom of peace.

Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti.
