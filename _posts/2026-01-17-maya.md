“Asato mā sad gamaya, tamaso mā jyotir gamaya, mṛtyor mā amṛtaṁ gamaya. Om śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ.”
Lead us from the unreal to the Real, from darkness to Light, from death to Immortality. Peace, peace, peace.

In the second talk of a series on Swami Vivekananda’s Jnana (Gyana) Yoga, the speaker chooses a subject he admits he has never taken up publicly before: **Maya**. He warns it may be the most difficult topic he has ever tried to explain. “Brahman is very simple,” he says, “my eye is complicated.” That single contrast sets the tone: reality is one, clear, and steady, while our lived experience is tangled, shifting, and hard to pin down.

Vivekananda devoted **three full lectures** to Maya in his London series on Jnana Yoga, and the speaker bases today’s summary on those talks. But before entering Vivekananda’s “refreshingly new” approach, he briefly walks through the classical Advaita Vedanta understanding, because Vivekananda’s originality becomes clearer when seen against the older philosophical background.

## A Story That Shows the Difficulty of Maya

A striking episode is shared from the reminiscences of **Manmatha Nath Ganguli**, a disciple of Vivekananda. Ganguli approaches his teacher with sincere insistence: “Please tell me, what is Maya?” Vivekananda initially says, “Ask something else.” But the disciple persists, almost pleading: if he cannot understand Maya from a guru like Vivekananda, he fears he never will.

When Vivekananda finally begins to explain, something unusual happens. Ganguli reports that the world around him seems to shimmer and dissolve, like the heat-waves above a fire that make a room vibrate in and out of focus. The room, Vivekananda’s form, even Ganguli’s sense of his own body falls away. He hears only the voice, and in a sudden outburst he cries, “All this is Maya! Even you, even this work, the monastery, the Ramakrishna Mission, all of it is Maya!”

Then, as he realizes he has addressed his guru too casually, the sense of difference snaps back, and the world returns. Vivekananda smiles and replies: “You are right. All this is Maya. If you do not like this play, go to the Himalayas and merge in Brahman. If you cannot, then come and help in this work.”

That story captures the theme: Maya is not merely an idea we talk about. It is something that shakes our sense of reality, identity, and certainty.

## Classical Advaita: “Brahman Alone Is Real”

Across Indian philosophy, many schools accept Maya in some form. In many traditions, Maya is understood as **the power of God (Shakti)**: a real creative power producing a real universe. Advaita Vedanta, however, takes a uniquely sharp stance.

Its famous formulation is:

**Brahma satyam, jagat mithyā, jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ.**
Brahman alone is real. The world is mithya, an appearance. The individual soul is none other than Brahman.

Here, “mithya” is closely related to “Maya”: the world is not unreal like a square circle, but it is not ultimately real in itself. It is an appearance dependent on Brahman. The core problem becomes **ignorance (ajñāna)** of our true nature. Knowledge (jñāna) is the solution.

To show how carefully Advaita tried to define this mysterious ignorance, the speaker cites the traditional textbook **Vedantasara**, which presents Maya through several characteristics. In summary, Maya is said to be:

* Not describable as simply “is” or “is not” (anirvachaniya)
* Associated with the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas)
* Opposed to knowledge in the sense that knowledge negates it (jñāna-virodhi)
* Not merely absence, but a positive force with functions (bhāvarūpa)
* Ultimately “something indescribable” that vanishes under deep inquiry (yat kinchit)

Advaita also explains two main functions of Maya: **avarana** (veiling the truth) and **vikṣepa** (projecting error). The rope-snake example makes it vivid: first, the rope is not recognized as rope (veiling). Then it is misperceived as a snake (projection).

Sri Ramakrishna’s imagery deepens it further: Sita stands between Rama and Lakshmana as the veil; hyacinth covers a pond until pushed aside; muddy water fails to reflect the sun; the cobra’s poison harms others but not itself, pointing to Maya’s power in the world without trapping Ishwara.

## The Attacks on Maya: Seven “Inconsistencies”

This classical framework attracted intense critique, especially from the theistic and qualified non-dualist schools. The speaker highlights Ramanuja’s famous sevenfold critique (sapta-vidha anupapatti), which targets Maya as the “weak link” in Advaita. The questions are hard-hitting:

Where does ignorance reside? In Brahman or in the individual? What is its nature? How can something be neither real nor unreal? How can Maya veil Brahman? Is ignorance a positive entity or merely absence? What knowledge removes it? And if Maya is beginningless, can anyone truly escape it?

These objections were not minor academic sparring. They fueled centuries of rigorous debate, sharpening Indian philosophy like an “arms race” of logic and interpretation.

## Vivekananda’s Turn: Maya as Lived Contradiction

Now comes the heart of the lecture: **Vivekananda does not treat Maya primarily as a metaphysical explanation.** He reframes it as a direct description of the paradoxical fabric of life.

“Maya is not a theory,” he insists. It is a **statement of fact**: the world, and our experience within it, is riddled with contradictions. Common people say, “All is Maya,” and Vivekananda considers that blunt simplicity to be profoundly accurate.

The speaker notes that Vivekananda repeats the phrase “and this is Maya” again and again, with relentless force, applying it to the most human realities:

* **Death and the clinging to life:** Everything dies, and yet we grasp at life with desperate intensity. Saints and sinners, kings and paupers, the learned and the ignorant, all are swept away. We know this, and still we live as if exempt.
* **Knowledge and its limits:** We feel we can know, and we keep expanding knowledge, but we hit walls: immeasurable space, endless time, and the chain of causation. The more we know, the more we discover the horizon of the unknown.
* **Sense pleasures and their dissatisfaction:** Pleasures promise fulfillment, deliver a fragment, and leave a larger hunger behind. Even knowing this, we repeat the chase, “like moths to the fire.”
* **Freedom and bondage:** With every breath we feel free, yet life repeatedly shows constraints. The will feels sovereign, but our conditions, impulses, and limits argue otherwise.
* **Progress and redistributed misery:** Social reforms and revolutions aim at happiness, but misery seems to move locations rather than vanish. As enjoyment increases, suffering can intensify, and refinement can create fragility.

One example is especially piercing: a mother’s love can become a bond she cannot shake even when it brings misery. Society praises her, condemns the ungrateful child, yet Vivekananda points to the deeper captivity: she cannot easily let go, even if letting go would heal her.

And then the grand theatrical image: the stage stays, actors change. Childhood, youth, adulthood, disappointment, and then death, victorious or defeated, we do not know. The drama rolls on. And this is Maya.

## Narada and Krishna: Twelve Years in Half an Hour

To crystallize Maya, the speaker retells the famous story: Narada asks Krishna, “What is Maya?” Krishna asks for water. Narada walks to a village, meets a girl, falls in love, marries, builds a life, has children. Then a flood sweeps everything away. He wakes to find Krishna standing there: “Where have you been? I’ve been waiting nearly half an hour.”

Twelve years of life, compressed into minutes. A whole world of attachments created and destroyed. That dizzying disproportion is the taste of Maya.

## Two Objections, and the Vedantic Response

Vivekananda anticipates two modern objections.

One is the progressive idea, associated with Hegel: that the Absolute evolves through history toward perfection. Vivekananda rejects this. Any “expression” in time, space, and causation is limitation. The Infinite cannot become Infinite by expressing itself as finite forms. At best, it produces refined finitudes, not Infinity itself.

So Vedanta proposes a different movement: **pravritti and nivritti**. Outward expansion into the world is pravritti. Turning inward toward the source is nivritti. True spirituality begins with that inward return. Peace is not finally found in objects, but in the subject, the ground of experience.

The second objection is modern agnosticism: we do not know ultimate truths, so just live well and make the best of it. Vivekananda replies that life always contains an “ideal” overflow, a drive to transcend what is given. Religion, art, science, and the hunger for freedom arise because the heart refuses to settle for a closed horizon.

The quest for freedom, he says, has always been there: from early gods imagined as free from hunger and death, to the one God beyond the universe, to the immanent divine presence within all, and finally to Advaita’s summit: **Tat tvam asi**, **Aham brahmasmi**. What Maya hid was never merely information. It hid **you**. You are the reality you sought.

## Beyond Maya: The Same World, Transfigured

The lecture ends where the opening prayer points: from death to immortality, from darkness to light. The world does not necessarily vanish. Rather, the standpoint changes. From the light of realization, the same world that seemed like struggle and limitation is seen differently. The drama remains, but you know yourself as the screen, not merely the passing scene.

And so the prayer returns, not as poetry but as direction:

“Asato mā sad gamaya, tamaso mā jyotir gamaya, mṛtyor mā amṛtaṁ gamaya. Om śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ.”
