snippet: "Using Vedanta, we read Labour’s landslide as karma, dharma, and renewal in public life."
---
In July 2024 the United Kingdom voted for change, and a new Labour government formed under Keir Starmer. Headlines tallied seats, swings, and majorities, yet beneath numbers lives a subtler story: a nation’s mind moving through fear, fatigue, aspiration, and trust. Vedanta invites us to look past the surface drama without dismissing it, to see politics as a field where collective karma ripens and dharma can be renewed through conscious action. In that field, every voter and leader meets oneself.

The sages say, “All this, whatever moves in this moving world, is pervaded by the Lord.” Such vision does not make us passive; it makes us precise. When we remember the Self as the silent witness, we can engage public life with steadiness, compassion, and truthfulness. This essay reads the 2024 election as a mirror for inner governance, exploring how rajadharma, lokasangraha, and nishkama karma can inform leadership, opposition, and citizenship in a modern democracy. Facts first, then meaning follows.

## 1) Snapshot of the Moment: What Happened in July 2024

On 4 July 2024, voters across the United Kingdom elected a new House of Commons. The result produced a decisive change of government, and Keir Starmer became Prime Minister to lead a new administration. The Labour Party won 411 of the 650 seats, forming a large parliamentary majority. The Conservative Party fell to 121 seats, after fourteen years leading the government. The Liberal Democrats rose to 72 seats. Smaller parties varied in seat totals, but several drew notable shares of the vote, showing an electorate that is more plural than the seat map alone suggests.

Popular vote shares underlined this complexity. Labour’s national vote share was about 33.7 percent, while the Conservatives received about 23.7 percent. Reform UK drew about 14.3 percent of the vote yet won only five seats, an example often cited in debates about electoral systems. Turnout was about 59.7 percent. These figures do not settle any argument, but they show why many people can feel both that a result is decisive and that it is not perfectly representative of vote shares.

In ordinary political language, this was a landslide and a reset. It also displayed a system-specific effect: first-past-the-post can convert relatively modest changes in vote share into dramatic shifts in seats, while also limiting representation for dispersed minorities. These mechanics shape the emotional story. A citizen watching seat totals may feel a complete rupture, while a citizen watching vote shares may feel a slower change. Both perceptions can be sincere.

Vedanta begins by honoring what is. There is no spiritual gain in denying the lived impact of policies, prices, work, health services, housing, safety, or the daily pressures that make elections feel personal. Yet Vedanta also asks us to notice how quickly public moods shift, how narratives rise and fall, and how the same mind that clings to yesterday’s certainty can panic at tomorrow’s change. If we can hold the facts clearly while loosening our grip on the story we attach to them, we have already begun the yogic work of democracy: clarity without clinging.

A famous Upanishadic prayer asks: “From the unreal lead me to the real; from darkness lead me to light; from death lead me to immortality.” Read civically, it is a request to move from noise to clarity, from distortion to honesty, from despair to steadier hope. Elections do not grant immortality, but they can invite renewal. The question is whether renewal stays at the level of slogans or becomes an ethical turn that endures after the victory speeches end.

## 2) The Play of Prakriti: Change Is a Law, Not an Enemy

A central Vedantic reminder is that all forms are in motion. The Bhagavad Gita describes the embodied world as a field of change, and it trains the mind to meet change without inner collapse. “That which is not, never comes to be; that which is, never ceases to be.” The stable reality is not the moving scene; it is the awareness in which the scene appears.

Politics is an intense theater of prakriti, the dynamic power that expresses itself as institutions, incentives, personalities, and collective moods. A party rises, another declines; leaders appear, age, resign, and are replaced; policies are announced, revised, and sometimes reversed. If we expect permanence from what is by nature impermanent, we suffer twice: once from events, and again from our refusal to accept their changing nature.

Vedanta does not say outcomes do not matter. It says our freedom depends on where we locate identity. If I am only my preferred outcome, then the ballot box becomes a judge of my worth. If I remember the Self, the witness of outcomes, then I can work passionately while remaining inwardly sane. In that sanity, democracy becomes less like a battlefield and more like a discipline.

The Gita offers another hard truth that fits politics well: “This world is impermanent and joyless, so worship Me.” The phrase “joyless” does not mean that no happiness exists. It means that worldly happiness is unstable, mixed with anxiety, and always conditional. Elections can bring relief, but relief is not final. A Vedantic citizen enjoys relief without mistaking it for liberation.

This helps us interpret dramatic political shifts without panic. A shift of power is neither apocalypse nor salvation. It is a change in the management of the same human condition. Vedanta invites us to reduce idolization. Leaders are human instruments in a vast causal field. “As rivers flow and vanish in the sea, losing name and form, so the knower, freed from name and form, reaches the luminous Self.” When we remember this, we do not withdraw from civic duty. We withdraw from the habit of making a single leader, party, or policy to carry the weight of ultimate meaning.

## 3) Karma in a Collective Key: How Nations Reap

Karma is often reduced to a slogan, but in Vedanta it names an orderly relationship between action and consequence. Karma is not fatalism. It is intelligibility: patterns arise from conditions, choices create momentum, and results mature over time. Causes can be visible or hidden, short-term or delayed. Yet they are not random.

A national election is collective karma made visible. Millions of private experiences, disappointments, hopes, and ethical judgments gather into a shared act. The 2024 outcome can be read as a ripening of many years of causes: economic pressures, shifting trust in institutions, public fatigue, and the longing for competence and steadiness. Vedanta would ask: what seeds have been sown, and what harvest is now being demanded?

Yet Vedanta also cautions against simplistic moral arithmetic. A landslide is not a divine endorsement, and a defeat is not cosmic punishment. Human motives are mixed. In the same vote there can be altruism and anger, insight and imitation, idealism and resignation. Karma is exact in its law, but the human mind is inexact in interpretation.

A useful line from the tradition says: “The mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberation.” Applied socially, the public mind shapes the quality of politics. When the public mind rewards seriousness, leaders tend to become serious. When the public mind rewards performance, leaders tend to become performers. When the public mind tolerates corruption, corruption becomes normalized. These are karmic feedback loops.

Therefore, the deepest lesson of the 2024 election is not only about who holds office. It is about how citizens, media, and institutions can refine the mental climate that selects and shapes leaders. Vedanta would say: to change the outer, also change the inner. A nation’s karma is not a single event. It is the ongoing habit of attention, speech, and choice.

## 4) Dharma and Rajadharma: What Power Is For

Karma explains how outcomes arise. Dharma asks what ought to be done. Dharma is the principle of right ordering that supports life, like the hidden architecture of a stable building. In governance it becomes rajadharma, the dharma of those who hold power.

Vedantic culture holds an uncompromising view: power is legitimate only when it protects. The test is not rhetorical brilliance or factional victory. It is whether the weakest are safer, whether institutions become more trustworthy, and whether social cohesion strengthens. Rajadharma includes justice, economic fairness, public safety, and the restraint of ego-driven misuse of authority.

This is where Vedanta becomes sharply practical. A leader with self-control can hear criticism without collapsing into defensiveness. A leader without self-control will treat criticism as humiliation and respond with retaliation. A party with self-control can revise policy in light of evidence. A party without self-control will defend the indefensible because it confuses concession with defeat.

The 2024 transition offers a fresh test of rajadharma. The question is not only, “Who won?” It is, “Can power be exercised without intoxication?” Vedanta calls intoxication pramada, negligence born of ego. When victory becomes identity, dharma thins. When service becomes identity, dharma strengthens.

## 5) Loksangraha: The Yoga of Holding Society Together

The Bhagavad Gita offers a term that is almost a definition of public service: lokasangraha, the welfare and cohesion of the world. “Whatever the best person does, others follow; whatever standard they set, the world pursues.” In a democracy, “best person” is not a claim of superiority. It is a call to responsibility. Those in visible roles shape the mood of millions.

Loksangraha asks leaders to act in ways that reduce fragmentation. It does not mean suppressing disagreement. It means refusing to profit from division. It means speaking to the whole nation, not only to a faction. It means building institutions that outlast electoral cycles, because human wellbeing requires continuity as much as change.

The Gita also speaks of a lineage of wise governance: “This yoga was known to the royal sages.” The phrase royal sage, rajarshi, is a beautiful ideal: authority joined with inner wisdom. It does not require perfection. It requires orientation. Is leadership oriented toward self-promotion or toward stewardship?

From this angle, Keir Starmer’s rise is not mainly a story about one individual. It is a moment when a system hands the steering wheel to a new team. Vedanta would say: the person is an instrument; the deeper question is the quality of the instrument. Is it sattvic, clear and steady? Is it rajasic, ambitious and restless? Is it tamasic, negligent and dull? No leader is purely one quality, but the dominant tone matters.

A Vedantic society would demand policy competence, but it would also demand tone: the tone of debate, the tone of accountability, the tone of care. Loksangraha is as much about culture as about law. It is the invisible glue that allows disagreement without rupture.

## 6) The Three Gunas in a Democratic Mood

Vedanta analyzes prakriti through three qualities, the gunas: sattva (clarity), rajas (restlessness), and tamas (inertia). These are not moral labels; they are patterns of energy. Every mind contains all three, and societies do as well.

A satvic political culture values truth, patience, and competent administration. It can sustain complex conversations about tradeoffs. It can honor opponents without romanticizing them. It can admit error without panic.

A rajasic political culture values speed, spectacle, and conquest. It loves campaigns more than governance. It often confuses noise with effectiveness. It can achieve rapid change, but it also burns people out, because rajas consumes attention.

A tamasic political culture values denial, scapegoating, and numbness. It avoids responsibility. It normalizes incompetence by lowering expectations. It can appear stable for a while, but its stability is stagnation.

The July 2024 election can be read as a collective attempt to move away from tamasic fatigue and toward a satvic desire for steadiness. Yet rajas will still be present, because modern media and competition naturally stimulate it. The Vedantic task is to consciously cultivate sattva in public life. This is done through honest institutions, transparent procedures, education that trains critical thinking, and leaders who model restraint.

The Gita gives a diagnostic clue: when clarity grows, one sees. When restlessness grows, one grasps. When inertia grows, one sleeps. Applied politically, clarity enables real reform, grasping produces performative reform, and sleeping allows problems to rot. Therefore, the most important question is not, “Which slogan wins?” It is, “Which mental quality is being cultivated in the country?”

## 7) Sattva in Public Speech: Truth Without Cruelty

Vedanta places immense weight on speech. Words are forces that shape minds. The tradition praises satya, truth, not as a weapon but as alignment with reality. A classical guideline says: speak truth, speak what is beneficial, do not speak truth in a way that is cruel. Truth without compassion becomes brutality. Compassion without truth becomes sentimentality.

Modern politics often rewards agitation. A viral sentence can outweigh a careful paragraph. A Vedantic reading of the 2024 election therefore includes a warning: even a strong mandate can be squandered if leaders, opponents, and media allow speech to become a factory of hostility.

Sattvic speech does three things. First, it tells the truth, including inconvenient truths about budgets, tradeoffs, and limitations. Second, it refuses to humiliate. Humiliation is a short-term fuel that leaves long-term ash. Third, it invites participation. Democracy is not only voting; it is also listening, persuading, and revising.

The Gita treats speech discipline as a form of austerity: words that do not agitate, that are truthful, pleasant, and beneficial, and that support study of wisdom. Imagine this as a national experiment. If leaders practiced it, debates would slow down but deepen. If citizens practiced it, social media would lose heat but gain light.

For the new government, the spiritual challenge is to speak steadily in both praise and crisis. For the opposition, the challenge is to critique without contempt. For citizens, the challenge is to stop rewarding outrage as entertainment. The mind consumes media the way the body consumes food. Junk media creates junk reactions. Vedanta calls this ahara, mental diet.

## 8) The Ethics of Possession: “Tena Tyaktena Bhunjitha”

Economic debates often dominate elections. People worry about wages, costs, public services, and the future. Vedanta does not dismiss these concerns. It frames them. One of the most quoted lines from the Isha Upanishad is: “Enjoy through renunciation.” The Sanskrit phrase often used is “tena tyaktena bhunjitha,” which points to a paradox: life is enjoyed more deeply when grasping softens.

In civic terms, this principle invites two kinds of restraint.

First, restraint in personal consumption. When citizens are trained only as consumers, they become politically fragile. They demand constant gratification, and any delay becomes rage. A culture that remembers restraint can tolerate long projects, gradual reforms, and shared sacrifice when needed.

Second, restraint in institutional power. Governments that treat resources as spoils produce distrust. Governments that treat resources as stewardship produce trust. The same is true of corporations, unions, regulators, and media organizations. “Enjoy through renunciation” becomes a moral instruction for the entire ecosystem: do not extract more than is sustainable, do not hoard what is needed elsewhere, do not turn the common good into private vanity.

A Vedantic view is not anti-wealth. It is anti-attachment. Wealth can be a tool for dharma or a chain for ego. The difference is motive and use. If a nation can practice the Upanishadic paradox even partially, economic policy becomes less a battlefield of resentment and more a shared project of wellbeing.

## 9) The Leader’s Inner Work: Nishkama Karma in Government

One of Vedanta’s most practical gifts to public life is the ethic of nishkama karma, action without selfish grasping for results. “Your right is to action alone, never to its fruits,” says the Gita. This is often misunderstood as indifference. It is full engagement without inner bondage.

In governance, fruits are intoxicating: approval ratings, headlines, internal party battles, and the temptation to act for image rather than substance. Nishkama karma does not forbid strategy, but it demands purity of motive: act because it is right, not because it flatters ego.

A Vedantic leader would practice three disciplines.

**First, clarity of purpose.** Define a limited set of priorities and pursue them steadily. If everything is urgent, nothing is accomplished. A restless mind wants to announce new initiatives constantly. A clear mind knows that deep change requires patience.

**Second, humility before complexity.** Societies are not machines. Every policy touches multiple lives and produces side effects. Humility is not weakness; it is realism. The wise person says, “I will act, and I will also listen, measure, and adjust.”

**Third, self-scrutiny.** Notice how quickly the mind shifts from service to self-preservation. The Upanishads insist on self-inquiry. Ask, “Who is acting?” and “For what?” This is corruption prevention in psychological form.

These disciplines are relevant to ministers, civil servants, advisors, local officials, and activists. Nishkama karma turns public work into yoga. It reduces the addiction to applause, which is one of the most destructive addictions in modern leadership.

## 10) The Opposition’s Yoga: Non-attachment Without Apathy

Non-attachment means not being owned by emotion, not refusing emotion. In a democratic system, the opposition has a dharma too: to scrutinize, to improve legislation, to represent those who feel unheard, and to prepare alternatives.

After a major defeat, the opposition faces tamasic temptation: despair, blame, cynicism. It also faces rajasic temptation: rage, revenge, scapegoating. Vedanta offers a third path: sattvic regrouping. Admit mistakes without self-hatred. Learn without humiliation. Speak to the nation without trying to frighten it into allegiance.

The Gita describes equanimity as strength: “The wise are the same in honor and dishonor, in friend and enemy.” This is training in steadiness so that action remains intelligent. An opposition that is steady becomes a service to democracy. An opposition that is reactive becomes a parasite on democracy.

For citizens who did not vote for the winning side, Vedanta offers consolation without escapism. You can grieve the outcome and still remain dignified. You can organize peacefully and still remain kind. You can resist policies you dislike without turning fellow citizens into enemies. Even-mindedness is not neutrality on values. It is steadiness in mind, so values can be pursued wisely.

## 11) Representation and Form: Institutions as Name and Form

The 2024 result renewed an old discussion about representation. Under first-past-the-post, a party can win a large majority of seats with a much smaller share of the popular vote, while another party can win millions of votes and receive only a handful of seats. This tension was sharply visible in 2024.

Vedanta can illuminate this without becoming partisan. Maya is appearance, the way the One appears as many through name and form. Institutions are also name and form. They are real at their level, yet they shape outcomes in ways that can hide deeper realities.

Seat totals are one form. Vote share is another. Voter turnout is another. Regional distribution is another. None alone captures the whole. A Vedantic mind can hold multiple levels at once: the legal legitimacy of the result, the psychological legitimacy perceived by citizens, and the moral legitimacy earned by how power is used after the win.

This multi-level view is close to the Upanishadic method of “neti, neti,” not this, not that. It does not mean nothing matters. It means no single frame exhausts reality. When citizens cling to one metric as absolute, they fight over a partial truth. When citizens can hold several metrics, they can reform institutions more intelligently.

Legitimacy is not a trophy; it is a responsibility. When a government knows that seat counts can amplify mandate, it may govern more inclusively. When opponents know the system shapes outcomes, they may critique without conspiracy thinking. Maya teaches humility about measurement.

## 12) The Antahkarana of a Nation: Fear, Desire, and Ego

Vedanta’s psychology is precise. The mind, intellect, memory, and ego are different functions, and each can dominate public life. Elections are not only contests of policy; they are contests of attention and identity.

When fear dominates, politics becomes security theater. When desire dominates, politics becomes consumerism with slogans. When ego dominates, politics becomes identity warfare. In all cases, the Self is forgotten, and the mind seeks salvation in external outcomes.

The 2024 election can be read as a shift in which fears and desires gained prominence. Some voters sought stability after turbulence. Some sought relief from cost pressures. Some sought renewed dignity in institutions. Some sought disruption. Even within one party’s coalition, motives differed, and the same voter could carry several motives at once.

Vedanta’s response is viveka, discrimination. Ask: what am I feeling, and what story is my mind attaching to it? Am I confusing preference with identity? Am I seeking wholeness from a minister, a manifesto, or a news anchor? The Chandogya Upanishad’s instruction, “Tat tvam asi, you are That,” is an antidote to political idolatry, the tendency to make a leader carry the weight of our unmet inner needs.

When citizens remember their deeper identity, they become harder to manipulate. When leaders remember their deeper identity, they become harder to corrupt. This is a psychological law.

## 13) Policy as Practice: The Four Purusharthas in Civic Life

Vedanta frames human life through four aims: dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. A society that overfeeds one aim at the cost of others becomes unstable.

Elections are often contests over artha: wages, taxes, housing, infrastructure, public services. These matter. Vedanta does not romanticize poverty. Yet Vedanta insists that artha without dharma becomes exploitation, and artha without moksha becomes anxiety.

A new government therefore faces a balancing act. It must address material strain while strengthening ethical trust. It must enable legitimate desire without turning citizens into mere consumers. It must protect freedom of conscience and inquiry, because moksha requires a culture where truth-seeking is honored.

Moksha is freedom within the world. A citizen may never enter a monastery, yet can still live with inner liberty by practicing non-attachment, honesty, and compassion in daily work. A policy environment that reduces needless stress can support that inner work. A society with less desperation gives people more space to practice dharma and reflection.

In this sense, policy can be treated as collective sadhana. Budgeting becomes restraint. Regulation becomes harm reduction. Education becomes cultivation of viveka. Public health becomes organized compassion. None of these replace meditation, but they can express its fruits.

## 14) Media, Algorithms, and Viveka: Discerning the Real

Modern elections are fought in attention. Algorithms reward intensity, novelty, and tribal affirmation. The result is a mind that is constantly stimulated and constantly dissatisfied.

Vedanta describes the senses as outward-going. Without training, the mind becomes a servant of stimuli. A democracy of untrained attention is vulnerable to manipulation, not only by bad actors but by virality itself.

The Gita maps an inner chain: contemplation leads to attachment, attachment to desire, desire to anger, anger to delusion, delusion to loss of memory, and loss of memory to ruin of judgment. Replace “contemplation of objects” with “doomscrolling,” and the psychological sequence still holds.

Viveka, discernment, is civic hygiene. It involves slowing down before sharing, checking claims, seeking context, and noticing emotional hooks. It also involves remembering that human beings are larger than their worst tweet or clumsiest speech. This memory of wholeness supports social repair.

If the 2024 election teaches anything, it is that trust is scarce. Vedanta would say: trust grows when minds are clear, and minds are clear when attention is disciplined. A citizen who practices silence each day is already strengthening democracy.

## 15) Healing After Landslides: Forgiveness, Accountability, and Renewal

A landslide rearranges more than seats. It rearranges emotions. Winners feel relief and vindication. Losers feel grief and humiliation. Those who abstained feel distance and sometimes guilt. In such moments, social healing becomes a spiritual practice.

Vedanta proposes two complementary virtues. The first is kshama, forgiveness, not as forgetfulness but as release of corrosive hatred. The second is tapas, disciplined accountability, not as self-flagellation but as willingness to learn.

Forgiveness without accountability becomes denial. Accountability without forgiveness becomes bitterness. The 2024 transition invites both. It invites the outgoing leadership to reflect honestly on why trust eroded. It invites the incoming leadership to remember that today’s triumph can become tomorrow’s burden if arrogance replaces service.

A traditional peace prayer says, “May all be happy; may all be free from illness; may all see what is auspicious; may no one suffer.” It is a standard. It reminds politics that the final measure is human wellbeing, not factional victory.

Renewal means rebuilding trust through small, consistent acts: keeping promises, admitting limits, correcting errors quickly, and treating opponents as fellow citizens. The Upanishadic “Om shanti, shanti, shanti” can be heard as peace in the outer world, peace in the shared environment, and peace in the inner mind. A democratic culture needs all three.

## 16) Practical Sadhana for Citizens and Officials

Vedanta becomes real when it becomes practiced. Here are disciplines that translate spiritual insight into civic maturity:

1. **Daily witness practice:** Sit quietly for ten minutes and watch thoughts about politics arise and pass. Learn the difference between awareness and opinion. The witness does not vote, yet it clarifies how voting is done.
2. **Speech discipline for one week:** Speak about public issues without sarcasm. Critique policies, not persons. Notice how the mind wants to score points, and return to clarity.
3. **Service in your locality:** Volunteer where outcomes are tangible: food banks, schools, community cleanups. Loksangraha begins near home, and it dissolves the fantasy that politics is only a spectator sport.
4. **Information fasting:** Choose one day a week with limited news intake. Replace it with reading primary documents, local reports, or long-form analysis. This reduces rajas.
5. **Steelman your opponent:** Articulate the best version of the other side’s concern, then respond. This is jnana yoga in conversation, because it forces honesty.
6. **Offer results to the Whole:** Before voting, campaigning, or posting, inwardly say, “May this action serve the common good.” This is nishkama karma applied to citizenship.

For officials and activists, the disciplines deepen:

- Keep a private journal of motive. Ask, “What did ego want today, and what did dharma require?”
- Build feedback loops with critics and ordinary residents. Treat critique as data, not insult.
- Protect those with less power, because dharma is tested where retaliation is easy.
- Practice regular solitude, even short. A leader without silence becomes a hostage of noise.
- Remember the Self in all. Equal regard becomes administrative ethics.

These practices are simple, not easy. They do not require everyone to agree. They require everyone to become more inwardly honest.

## 17) Democracy as Sadhana: The Middle Way

Vedanta often speaks of two kinds of error. One is indulgence, the mind running outward after objects, hoping that more acquisition will produce peace. The other is suppression, the mind pretending it has no desires, no fears, no stake in the world. Both errors create inner conflict. The disciplined path is a middle way: acknowledge the world, engage it, and keep the Self as the anchor.

Democracy can be practiced in the same spirit. The indulgent error appears as fanaticism: the belief that one party is pure, the other is evil, and the nation will be saved only by total victory. Fanaticism is a form of attachment. It narrows perception, and it justifies cruelty in the name of righteousness. The suppressive error appears as apathy: the belief that nothing matters, everyone is corrupt, and effort is pointless. Apathy is a form of inertia, tamas disguised as sophistication.

Sadhana means training. A democratic sadhana trains two capacities.

**First, inner steadiness.** The Gita says, “Samatvam yoga uchyate,” equanimity is called yoga. Equanimity does not erase moral passion. It prevents moral passion from turning into hatred. It allows a person to argue strongly, vote decisively, and still keep a human face.

**Second, ethical persistence.** Many problems require years, not weeks. Vedanta calls patience titiksha, the capacity to endure discomfort without losing purpose. Citizens need this patience. So do governments. The fruits of reform are often delayed, and delayed fruits tempt leaders to chase quick wins instead of deep repairs. Titiksha keeps attention on what is actually needed.

From this angle, the July 2024 election is not only a change of administration. It is an invitation to raise the level of participation. If you supported the winners, practice humility and responsibility. If you supported the losers, practice courage and constructive critique. If you did not vote, practice re-entry: learn, listen, and begin where you are. The Upanishads say, “Arise, awake, and learn from the wise.” In civic terms: wake up to the consequences of speech, of sharing, of voting, of serving, and learn from those who combine conviction with kindness.

When democracy is practiced as sadhana, it becomes less exhausting. The mind stops seeking final victory and starts seeking steady improvement. That shift is itself Vedantic, because it moves us from obsession with outcomes toward mastery of action and motive.

## 18) Benediction: A Vedantic Blessing for a New Chapter

The July 2024 election brought a new government, but it also revealed an enduring truth: societies, like minds, are always becoming. Vedanta teaches that the deepest stability is not found in a party, a leader, or a parliamentary majority. It is found in the Self that remains unchanged while history turns.

May those who govern remember rajadharma, the duty to protect and uplift. May those who oppose remember their dharma to improve, not to poison. May citizens remember that democracy is not only a system but a mirror, showing our collective fears and our collective possibilities.

Vedanta replies to cynicism with a practical line: “Yoga is skill in action.” Skill is not only technical competence; it is competence joined with inner clarity. When clarity joins compassion, and compassion joins truth, change becomes not a threat but a path.

Let the new chapter be guided by the Upanishadic prayer for wholeness: “That is whole, this is whole; from wholeness, wholeness arises; when wholeness is taken from wholeness, wholeness remains.” May public life remember wholeness, so differences can coexist without hatred, and power can serve rather than possess.

Om shanti, shanti, shanti.
