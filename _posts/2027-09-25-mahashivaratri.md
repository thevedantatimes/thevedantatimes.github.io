snippet: "The endless pillar teaches humility, reveals conceptual limits, and opens the heart into nondual awe."
---
On Shivaratri, the tale of the infinite pillar is not mere mythology; it is a mirror. Brahma searches upward, Vishnu dives downward, each striving to prove the beginning or end. Yet the pillar has none. The story gently exposes how the mind lives by measurement and victory. Vedanta uses this moment to turn our attention from rivalry to reverence, from argument to awe, and from outer conquest to inner stillness. today today today today today today today today today today

When the Infinite appears, concepts behave like birds in a sky without edges: they can fly, but not enclose. Shivaratri invites a courageous humility, the willingness to let thought point beyond itself. The pillar becomes a living teaching: seek sincerely, but do not cling to conclusions. Let inquiry ripen into silence, devotion ripen into discernment, and discipline ripen into direct seeing, until comparison dissolves and awareness stands self-luminous.

## The story as a spiritual diagnostic

The lingodbhava episode is often told like a cosmic drama: a blazing pillar appears, and two great deities respond as competitors.
One ascends to find the "top"; the other descends to find the "bottom." Their intention can look noble, even devotional: to know the truth.
Yet the style of seeking is mixed with the need to win.

Vedanta listens to the story as a diagnostic of our own inner life. When we are ruled by comparison, knowledge becomes a trophy.
When we are ruled by insecurity, discovery becomes domination. When we are ruled by anxiety, the sacred becomes a race.
The pillar does not punish the search. It simply refuses to be reduced into a measurable object.

In daily life, this pattern appears everywhere: we measure worth by metrics, relationships by advantage, and progress by applause.
The more we compare, the more reality seems scarce. The "other" becomes a threat. The future becomes a battlefield.
Shivaratri places the infinite pillar in the heart, then asks: What happens when the mind cannot finish its sentence?

## The pillar and the limits of concepts

The Upanishadic sages repeatedly warn that ultimate reality is not captured by language. A classic line says:
yato vaco nivartante aprapya manasa saha.
The teaching is not anti-intellectual. It is a kindness: it prevents the intellect from mistaking its map for the territory.

Concepts are powerful tools. They distinguish, compare, and organize. They help us navigate the world of names and forms.
But the Infinite is not one more form inside the world. It is the very ground in which forms arise and dissolve.

In the pillar story, Brahma symbolizes the mind's upward reach, the urge to climb toward a highest concept.
Vishnu symbolizes the mind's downward reach, the urge to locate a first cause, the "bottom" of explanation.
Both directions remain within the same game: the assumption that truth is an endpoint.

Vedanta proposes a subtler movement: let thought do its best, then relax the need for finality.
When thought becomes quiet, awareness does not disappear. It becomes obvious.
The "answer" is not a sentence; it is a shift of identity from the measured to the measurer.

## Rivalry, humility, and the purification of seeking

The story is also a lesson in adhikaritva, readiness. Spiritual inquiry is not only about sharp questions.
It is about the quality of the heart that asks. When rivalry is present, even correct knowledge can harden into pride.

In many tellings, Brahma's search includes a moment of distortion: the temptation to claim what was not truly found.
Whether one treats this as literal or symbolic, the inner message is clear: ego tries to end uncertainty by manufacturing certainty.
It is not evil; it is afraid. Pride is often fear wearing armor.

Shivaratri celebrates Shiva as the witness, the one who holds all movements without becoming a movement.
To stand before the infinite pillar is to let the armor drop. It is to allow not-knowing to be holy.
Humility here is not self-hatred. It is accurate perception: the Infinite cannot be owned.

When humility matures, rivalry dissolves, and the same energy that once competed now contemplates.
The seeker begins to love truth more than victory.

## Advaita reading: the pillar as the Self

In Advaita, Brahman is not an object. The Self is not "inside" the body as a thing.
The Self is that by which all experiences are known.

Read the pillar as the Self: beginningless, endless, not because it is a long object in space,
but because it is not in space in the ordinary way. Space itself is known within awareness.

If you try to "reach the top" of awareness, you end up with more thoughts.
If you try to "find the bottom" of awareness, you end up with more sensations, more memories, more states.
The pillar remains: the bare fact of knowing, present through waking, dreaming, and deep sleep,
as the continuity behind change.

This is why Shivaratri is often associated with the movement from tamas to wakefulness.
Wakefulness is not merely staying up at night. It is staying present as the witness of the night.

The practical implication is simple: stop searching for the Self as a special experience.
Instead, notice the constant presence that knows every experience.

## A practice sequence for Shivaratri night

Below is a sequence that turns the pillar theme into lived sadhana. Use it gently, without strain.

1. Offer rivalry into the fire.
   Write down the comparisons currently agitating you: "I should be ahead," "They have more," "I must prove."
   Read the list once, then place the page under a lamp or candle (safely). Whisper: "Not this measure."

2. Return to the witness in three breaths.
   Inhale and notice sound. Exhale and notice sensation. Inhale and notice thought. Exhale and notice the knower.
   Do this for nine rounds. Keep it ordinary. The point is steadiness, not drama.

3. Neti-neti as compassion.
   When a thought claims, "This is me," reply softly: "This too is known."
   When an emotion claims, "This is me," reply: "This too is known."
   Do not push away. Just unglue identity.

4. One line mantra, long line silence.
   Repeat Om Namah Shivaya for a few minutes, then sit without repeating.
   Let the mantra be a door into the pillar of quiet awareness.

5. Seal with service.
   Choose a small, concrete act of kindness the next morning.
   Let the insight become ethical fragrance.

## Twelve contemplations for the endless pillar

## Questions that keep the teaching honest

### Question 1: Is the story saying knowledge is useless?

No. It is saying knowledge becomes incomplete when it forgets its own limits. Use study to refine the mind, then let refined mind become quiet. In Vedanta, shravana and manana are essential, but they culminate in nididhyasana, the steady assimilation where identity shifts from thought to awareness.

### Question 2: How do I avoid replacing rivalry with spiritual superiority?

Treat humility as a daily discipline. Notice the subtle pleasure of being 'more spiritual' and offer it into sincerity. A helpful test is ethical: if practice makes you kinder, more patient, and less defensive, it is purifying. If it makes you sharp, contemptuous, or performative, rivalry has simply changed clothes.

### Question 3: What does 'Infinite' mean in practice?

It means you stop demanding that life fit your mental enclosure. You allow uncertainty to remain without panic. You measure what is measurable, but you do not measure your worth, your love, or your awareness in the same way. You learn to live from the witness, not from the scoreboard.

### Question 4: Is this compatible with devotion to Shiva as a personal Lord?

Yes. Devotion and nonduality can support each other when devotion ripens into surrender and surrender ripens into insight. The personal form steadies the heart; the nondual teaching clarifies identity. Shivaratri can hold both: worship with love, then rest as the consciousness in which love appears.

### Question 5: What if my mind keeps wandering?

Wandering is not failure; it is information. Return gently, without drama. Each return is a bow to the pillar. If needed, shorten the practice, anchor with breath, or use one steady mantra. Over time, the habit of returning becomes stronger than the habit of chasing.

## Closing: the victory of surrender

The infinite pillar does not ask you to abandon effort. It asks you to abandon arrogance.
Seek with sincerity. Study with rigor. Practice with steadiness.
But let your heart remain free from the need to defeat anyone, including yourself.

On Shivaratri, when the world grows quiet and the night feels deep, remember the pillar within.
Thoughts will rise, emotions will move, and life will remain beautifully unfinished.
Stand as the witness. Bow to the Infinite. Let comparison fall away.
Then walk into the next day carrying the simple fragrance of nondual peace.

A gentle way to test your understanding is to watch how you react when you are not recognized. If the heart tightens, rivalry is present. If the heart stays open, the pillar is being remembered. Nonduality is not an idea you defend; it is a spaciousness you live.

When the mind says, 'I must find the top,' ask, 'Who is aware of this urgency?' When the mind says, 'I must find the bottom,' ask, 'Who is aware of this story?' Each time you turn toward the knower, the pillar becomes less myth and more immediate experience.

In relationships, the pillar teaching becomes the art of listening without preparing a counterargument. Let the other person's words be present. Feel the impulse to win. Then rest as the witness of that impulse. This single shift can dissolve years of subtle competition.

In work and creativity, the pillar teaching becomes the art of excellence without ego. Do the task fully, learn continuously, and accept feedback. But do not tie your identity to being right. When identity loosens, energy becomes available for real mastery and quiet joy.

In spiritual communities, rivalry can disguise itself as lineage loyalty, doctrinal policing, or superiority about austerity. The pillar asks for simplicity: take what purifies you, honor what purifies others, and keep returning to compassion as the real proof of practice.

If you enjoy philosophical reflection, contemplate the difference between infinity as an unending series and infinity as the non-objective ground. The story points to the second: not 'more and more,' but 'that which is never outside.'

The pillar is also a lesson about time. The mind tries to finish time by grasping the past or controlling the future. Awareness is present in both, yet not bound by either. Shivaratri can be a night of befriending time by resting as the timeless witness.

Sometimes the deepest rivalry is with one's own shadow: the parts we deny, the habits we judge. Treat those parts with honesty and tenderness. The pillar does not reject anything; it reveals identity beyond the changing patterns.
