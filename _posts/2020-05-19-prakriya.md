---
Avasthā-traya, the “analysis of the three states,” is one of Vedānta’s most practical teaching methods because it begins with something intimate: your everyday experience. You already move through waking, dream, and deep sleep. Instead of treating these as merely biological events, Vedānta treats them as a living laboratory for self-inquiry. By carefully examining what changes across states and what does not, the mind is led from the familiar surface of experience toward the subtle recognition of the witnessing consciousness.

The genius of this prakriyā lies in its simplicity: it does not ask you to believe a doctrine first, but to observe. What is the world when you dream? Who are you when the body is absent? What remains in deep sleep when thought is absent? These questions are not meant to create philosophical puzzles. They are meant to loosen unconscious assumptions about “I,” “world,” and “reality,” and to point toward a stable center that silently illumines all experience.

## 1. Why Vedānta Uses Prakriyās

In Vedānta, a *prakriyā* is a method of unfolding truth. It is not merely a topic but a structured way of guiding the mind from confusion to clarity. Different minds cling to different starting points: some are moved by devotion, some by logic, some by meditation, and some by direct analysis of experience. Avasthā-traya belongs to the last category. It takes the everyday cycle of experience and turns it into a mirror.

The underlying challenge is this: most people assume that “I am the body,” “I am the mind,” and “the world is as I currently see it.” But these assumptions collapse when examined across states. In dream, the physical body and external world of waking are absent, yet a “world” appears and an “I” experiences it. In deep sleep, even the inner world of dream disappears, yet you later say, “I slept well.” So Vedānta asks: if body, mind, and world appear and disappear, can they be the final identity of the self?

A prakriyā does not deny the practical reality of your ordinary life. It simply asks you to distinguish *what you are* from *what you experience*. This distinction, when mature, is not cold detachment. It is clarity that reduces fear, anxiety, and compulsive grasping. When you know the difference between the screen and the movie, the movie can still be enjoyed, but it no longer hypnotizes you into forgetting the screen.

Avasthā-traya is also pedagogically powerful because it is universal. You do not need special mystical visions to apply it. Everyone has waking, dream, and deep sleep. This universality makes the method accessible and testable. It also keeps the inquiry honest: instead of chasing rare experiences, you investigate what is always present.

## 2. The Three States at a Glance

Vedānta identifies three primary states (*avasthās*):
1. **Jāgrat** (waking)
2. **Svapna** (dream)
3. **Suṣupti** (deep sleep)

Each state has its own “world,” its own sense of self, and its own instruments of knowing. Yet each is also impermanent. The prakriyā asks you to look at each state carefully and notice patterns:

- **In waking**, you experience a shared world, a body, thoughts, duties, relationships, and time.
- **In dream**, you experience a private world, a dream body, dream emotions, dream time, and dream consequences.
- **In deep sleep**, you experience no objects, no thoughts, no inner images, and no personal narrative.

But something ties these three together. You say:
- “I am awake.”
- “I dreamt.”
- “I slept.”

One “I” appears to be continuous across discontinuous experiences. The key inquiry is: what is this “I”? Is it the waking personality? The dream character? The absence of personality in deep sleep? Or something more fundamental that allows each of these to be known?

## 3. Waking State: Jāgrat

### 3.1 What Waking Feels Like

Waking feels obvious. It feels like the baseline. The senses present a world. The mind organizes it into meaning. Memory connects moments into continuity. The body feels like “me,” and the mind feels like “my mind.” In waking, you typically assume:
- The world exists independently “out there.”
- I am located in this body “in here.”
- Experience is a relation between me and the world.

Vedānta does not reject these as false for practical purposes. It asks whether they are the final truth about reality and self.

### 3.2 The Waking “I”: The Empirical Self

In waking, the “I” is usually the *empirical person*: a name, a biography, a set of roles, abilities, and limitations. This “I” says:
- “I am happy, I am sad.”
- “I did this, I want that.”
- “I fear death, I desire success.”

This “I” is functional and necessary for worldly life. Yet Avasthā-traya asks whether this is the *ultimate* self, because it is not present in the same way in dream, and it disappears entirely in deep sleep.

### 3.3 Waking World and Its Dependence

The waking world appears stable because it is consistent across many experiences and because it is shared. But stability does not automatically equal absoluteness. Your perception of waking reality depends on:
- Sense organs functioning
- Mind interpreting sensory data
- Attention selecting what matters
- Memory giving continuity
- Language shaping categories

When any of these change, your waking world changes. Consider fever, intoxication, depression, or intense joy: the same “world” can feel radically different. This suggests that waking experience, while valid, is conditioned.

Avasthā-traya uses this as a gentle wedge: if waking experience depends on conditions, perhaps it is not the final reference point for reality.

## 4. Dream State: Svapna

### 4.1 The Strange Authority of Dream

In dream, you often do not question the dream world. You may be flying, talking to someone long deceased, or living in a place you have never visited, yet the dream can feel compellingly real. The dream has its own internal logic, its own time, and its own emotional intensity. You may wake up with fear or relief as if something truly happened.

The crucial insight is not “dream is unreal.” The deeper insight is: *dream is experienced as real while it lasts*. This parallels waking. Waking feels real while it lasts, too. So the question becomes: what criteria do you use to declare one state “more real” than another?

### 4.2 Dream “I”: A Second Personality

In dream, you become a dream character. Sometimes it resembles the waking person, but often it differs. You may have a different body, different abilities, different relationships. Yet you still say “I” in the dream. That dream “I” experiences pleasure and pain. It hopes and fears. It acts and reacts.

When you wake, you say: “That was only a dream.” But while dreaming, you rarely say: “This is only a dream.” The dream “I” is convinced.

This teaches a subtle point: the sense of “I” can attach to different bodies and narratives. Therefore, the “I” you take yourself to be may be more flexible than you assume.

### 4.3 Dream World: Mind-Created Yet Lived

Dream is often described as mind-projected. But calling it “mind-projected” does not reduce its felt reality inside the state. The dream has objects, people, landscapes, and events. Even if later you explain them as internal, within the dream they function like an external world.

Vedānta’s use of dream is not to dismiss life as fantasy, but to show how experience can be constructed and still be compelling. This is meant to loosen your grip on the assumption that whatever appears vividly must be ultimately real.

### 4.4 The Teaching Function of Dream

Dream reveals:
- Objects can appear without physical senses
- A world can appear without waking externality
- The “I” can shift identities
- Time and space can be fluid

By seeing these, you begin to suspect that waking reality, too, might be more dependent on consciousness and mind than you ordinarily admit.

## 5. Deep Sleep State: Suṣupti

### 5.1 The Mystery of “Nothing Happened”

Deep sleep appears as a blank. There is no world, no thoughts, no images, no sense of “I am this person.” Yet almost everyone reports something like:
- “I slept well.”
- “I didn’t know anything.”
- “I was not aware.”

These statements are important. How do you know you were not aware? How do you know you slept well? The waking mind infers some things, but the sense of rest and discontinuity is direct enough that it becomes a powerful philosophical clue.

### 5.2 Vedānta’s Focus: Not Objects, But the Absence of Objects

In deep sleep, there are no objects to know. Yet the self is not destroyed. If the self were the waking mind, it would cease to exist in deep sleep. But you do not feel that you ceased to exist; you feel that you ceased to experience objects.

This distinction is vital. Vedānta says: deep sleep reveals that you can exist without the waking mind’s constant activity. That suggests the self is not identical with the mind’s changing modifications.

### 5.3 Bliss and Ignorance: Two Aspects

Traditional Vedānta describes deep sleep as having two notable aspects:
- **A kind of undifferentiated peace or happiness** (since there is no mental agitation)
- **Ignorance or non-apprehension** (since no objects are known)

From ordinary experience, deep sleep can feel restful. But it is not liberation, because the ignorance returns as waking begins. You wake up with the same tendencies, the same identity, the same confusions.

So deep sleep teaches both:
- The self is not dependent on thought for existence
- The absence of thought alone is not enlightenment

## 6. The Fourth: Turīya and the Witness

### 6.1 Why Vedānta Speaks of a “Fourth”

After analyzing the three states, Vedānta points to *Turīya*, literally “the fourth.” But Turīya is not a fourth state in the way dream is a state. It is the underlying reality because of which the three states are known. It is the witnessing consciousness (*sākṣī*).

If waking is like a movie, dream is another movie, and deep sleep is like the screen with no movie playing, Turīya is the screen itself: ever-present, unaffected by the content.

### 6.2 The Logic of the Witness

Across states, everything changes:
- Bodies change (waking body vs dream body vs no body)
- Worlds change (shared world vs private world vs no world)
- Minds change (thinking mind vs dreaming mind vs silent mind)

Yet you later connect them:
- “I was awake.”
- “I dreamt.”
- “I slept.”

This continuity implies a witnessing principle that is not limited to any single state. The witness is not a thought, because thoughts come and go. It is that in whose presence thoughts appear.

Vedānta often emphasizes: the witness is not an object you can see, because it is the seer. You cannot “objectify” the witness without turning it into another experience. Instead, you recognize it as the constant fact of awareness itself.

### 6.3 What the Witness Is Not

Avasthā-traya is also used as a method of negation:
- You are not merely the waking body.
- You are not merely the dream character.
- You are not the blankness of deep sleep.

Then what are you? The witness of all three, the awareness in which all three appear and disappear.

This is not meant to create a remote, abstract identity. It is meant to show that your deepest identity is stable and free from the fluctuations of life’s narratives.

## 7. Mapping the Components: Experiencer, Instruments, Objects

Vedānta often analyzes experience with a simple structure:
- **Knower (pramātā)**
- **Means of knowledge (pramāṇa)**
- **Known object (prameya)**

In waking:
- Knower: waking ego-person
- Means: senses + mind
- Known: waking world objects

In dream:
- Knower: dream ego-person
- Means: mind (projecting and perceiving)
- Known: dream objects

In deep sleep:
- Knower: not available as ego-person
- Means: not functioning as knowing instruments
- Known: no objects

So what remains consistent? The “light” of consciousness that allows any knowing to be possible in the first place.

The prakriyā trains you to separate consciousness from its instruments. The eyes do not “see” by themselves; they are instruments. The mind does not “know” by itself; it is an instrument. Consciousness illumines them, and therefore their operations become known.

## 8. Avasthā-traya and the Nature of Reality

### 8.1 Reality as “That Which Does Not Change”

One classical criterion used in Vedānta for ultimate reality is invariability: that which is truly real does not undergo change. Waking, dream, and deep sleep are all changing. They are episodes. Therefore, they cannot be the ultimate reality in the strictest sense.

This does not mean they are “nonexistent.” It means their reality is dependent, not absolute. They are real at their level, like a wave is real as a form of the ocean, but not independent of the ocean.

### 8.2 The World’s Status Through the Lens of Dream

Dream serves as a teaching analogy:
- In dream, the world appears, interacts, and affects you.
- On waking, you recognize it as dependent on mind and consciousness.

Similarly, in waking, the world appears, interacts, and affects you.
- Vedānta suggests that waking, too, is dependent on a deeper consciousness.

This is the controversial leap for many: are you being asked to treat waking as “just a dream”? The careful answer is: Vedānta uses dream to show dependence, not to trivialize experience. The waking world has its own order (*vyavahāra*), ethical consequences, and practical stability. Yet, in relation to the absolute, it is not final.

### 8.3 Levels of Reality: Practical and Absolute

Vedānta often distinguishes:
- **Practical reality**: the waking world where actions, ethics, and knowledge operate
- **Absolute reality**: nondual consciousness, unaffected and self-luminous

Avasthā-traya helps you respect practical reality while not mistaking it for the ultimate. This is not escapism. It is perspective.

## 9. Psychological Value of Three-State Inquiry

### 9.1 Reducing Identification and Suffering

Much suffering comes from rigid identification:
- “I am my body, therefore aging terrifies me.”
- “I am my mind, therefore anxiety defines me.”
- “I am my story, therefore failure destroys me.”

Avasthā-traya gently loosens this by showing that the “I” you cling to is state-dependent. If it disappears in deep sleep, it cannot be your deepest nature. The result can be a lighter relationship to thoughts and emotions.

### 9.2 Bringing Humility to Certainty

Dream shows how certain you can be about something that later is revealed to be contingent. This cultivates humility about waking judgments. You still act, decide, and live. But you become less arrogant about the finality of your perceptions.

### 9.3 Strengthening Witness-Consciousness in Daily Life

Practically, people use the witness perspective as a mental stance:
- Thoughts arise and pass.
- Feelings arise and pass.
- Experiences arise and pass.

You are the knower of them, not their prisoner. This stance is not dissociation in the unhealthy sense. It is clarity with intimacy: you can feel fully, while knowing you are not limited to what you feel.

## 10. Common Misunderstandings

### 10.1 “Deep Sleep Is Enlightenment”

Deep sleep is peaceful but ignorant. Liberation is not blankness. Liberation is knowledge: clear recognition of the self as consciousness, even while waking experiences continue.

### 10.2 “Witness Means I Should Not Care”

Witness does not mean indifference. It means non-confusion. You can care deeply without being internally bound. In fact, clarity often makes compassion more stable because it is less entangled with egoic fear.

### 10.3 “This Denies the World”

Avasthā-traya does not deny the pragmatic world. It asks you to see that the world is known within consciousness and therefore cannot be independent of the knower in the way you assume. This shifts your metaphysical stance without destroying ethical responsibility.

### 10.4 “The Witness Is a Thought”

People sometimes try to *think* the witness. But any thought you can observe is not the witness. The witness is the observing presence itself. You do not create it. You notice it.

## 11. Applying Avasthā-traya in Contemplation

Here are practical contemplations aligned with the method, expressed as gentle inquiry rather than forced logic:

### 11.1 Waking Inquiry
- What in my experience is constant and what is changing?
- The body changes, thoughts change, situations change. What knows these changes?
- Is awareness itself changing, or are changing contents appearing in awareness?

### 11.2 Dream Inquiry
- In dream, I took a projected world as real. What made it convincing?
- In waking, what makes this world convincing?
- Can I notice the dependence of experience on mind even while living normally?

### 11.3 Deep Sleep Inquiry
- In deep sleep, there were no objects. Yet I existed and later recall the rest.
- What is that “I” that remains when personality disappears?
- Can I recognize a background presence even now, beneath thought?

### 11.4 Integrating the Witness
During the day, periodically pause and notice:
- Sounds are known.
- Sights are known.
- Thoughts are known.
- Emotions are known.

Then notice the simple fact: *knowing is present*. The practice is not to suppress anything, but to rest in the fact that awareness is already here, already free.

## 12. Avasthā-traya in Relation to Other Vedānta Teachings

Avasthā-traya connects naturally with several core Vedānta ideas:

### 12.1 Neti Neti: “Not This, Not This”
Three-state analysis is a structured neti neti:
- Not waking body-mind
- Not dream body-mind
- Not sleep blankness

What remains is the witness.

### 12.2 Adhyāsa: Superimposition
The empirical “I” is often a superimposition on consciousness:
- You superimpose “I am the body” on awareness.
- You superimpose “I am the thinker” on awareness.
Three-state inquiry weakens these superimpositions.

### 12.3 Māyā and Nāma-Rūpa
The appearing worlds of waking and dream are forms, names, and experiences that arise within a deeper reality. Seeing their state-dependence prepares the mind to understand māyā not as mere illusion, but as the principle of appearance.

### 12.4 Jīva and Ātman
The jīva is the individual self bound to a body-mind complex. Ātman is pure consciousness. Avasthā-traya shows that jīva is not present in deep sleep, yet existence continues, pointing toward Ātman.

## 13. A Deeper Subtlety: Continuity Without a Narrative

A common worry arises: “If the witness is beyond mind, how can there be continuity?” The answer is subtle. Continuity of consciousness is not the same as continuity of memory.

Memory is a function of mind. It disappears in deep sleep. Yet consciousness need not disappear because memory disappears. You can be present without recording. Deep sleep shows the possibility of existence without narrative. That insight becomes spiritually potent in waking life: you can be present without compulsively narrating everything.

This is why the witness perspective often brings a sense of spaciousness. Life continues, but the inner commentary loosens. You become less like a person trapped in a story and more like awareness in which stories play.

## 14. The “I” Across States: A Careful Distinction

To make the inquiry precise, Vedānta distinguishes:
- **Ego-I (ahaṅkāra)**: the personal “I” in waking and dream
- **Witness-I (sākṣī)**: the illuminating consciousness underlying all states

In waking and dream, ego-I says “I know.” In deep sleep, ego-I is absent. Yet later you report sleep. The witness-I is not the ego. The witness does not claim ownership; it illumines.

This distinction prevents confusion:
- You do not have to destroy the ego to live.
- You simply stop mistaking the ego for the ultimate self.

The ego becomes a tool rather than a tyrant.

## 15. Ethical Implications of Avasthā-traya

Some people fear that nondual teachings erode morality. But Avasthā-traya can deepen ethics by reducing egocentric grasping.

When identity loosens from “I am this fragile story,” several things naturally mature:
- Less reactive anger (because ego-injury matters less)
- Less envy (because comparison loses its sting)
- More compassion (because others are not “others” in the same rigid way)
- More responsibility (because clarity improves choices)

Vedānta does not ask you to become passive. It asks you to act without bondage. In traditional language, this supports *karma yoga*: acting with dedication while resting inwardly in freedom.

## 16. Avasthā-traya and Meditation

Avasthā-traya is not meditation itself, but it supports meditation by refining the understanding of experience.

In meditation, you may observe thoughts and sensations. Three-state analysis gives a larger map:
- Thoughts belong to waking mind activity.
- Dream-like imagery may appear in meditation, similar to svapna.
- Deep stillness may resemble suṣupti.

But the goal is not to chase stillness or blankness. The goal is recognition of the witnessing presence in all conditions. Then meditation becomes less about manufacturing special states and more about stabilizing insight.

This is why Vedānta often cautions: do not confuse a quiet mind with liberation. Quiet mind is valuable, like a clean mirror. But the recognition of the self as awareness is the deeper shift.

## 17. Bringing It Home: A Simple Daily Experiment

If you want Avasthā-traya to be more than philosophy, try this gentle daily experiment:

1. **Morning (after waking):**  
   Recall that the dream world felt real. Ask: what made it feel real? Notice: awareness was present in dream. Now awareness is present in waking.

2. **Midday (during activity):**  
   Pause for ten seconds. Notice: experience is changing. Awareness is present. Ask: what in this moment is constant?

3. **Night (before sleep):**  
   Recognize: soon waking identity will dissolve into sleep. Yet “I” will not be destroyed. Ask: what am I, beyond the roles of waking?

Over time, this experiment builds an inner continuity not based on story, but on awareness.

## 18. Conclusion: The Gift of Three-State Wisdom

Avasthā-traya is a compassionate method because it begins where you already are. You already wake, dream, and sleep. Vedānta simply asks you to look carefully. The reward of this looking is not an exotic experience, but a quiet revolution in identity.

When you recognize that waking, dream, and deep sleep are changing modes of experience, you stop clinging to any one mode as absolute. And when you recognize the witnessing consciousness as the constant background, you begin to taste a freedom that does not depend on circumstances. Life continues with all its beauty and complexity, yet something within is no longer shaken in the same way. The changing states still come and go, but you know yourself as that which remains.

In that recognition, the three states become not a cycle that traps you, but a teaching that liberates you: a daily reminder that you are the awareness in which all experience appears, and that awareness is fundamentally free.
