snippet: "Through Advaita and karma yoga, read renewed inauguration as leadership, illusion, and service today."
---
On a cold January morning in 2025, the oath and inaugural words marked the opening of a second presidential term in Washington. The ceremony was not only a constitutional hinge but also a collective mirror, reflecting hopes, fears, memories, and unfinished national stories. White House records preserve the address and the first acts that followed, yet the deeper question remains: what happens within the mind of a nation when power is handed, received, and promised anew for every citizen watching.

Vedanta approaches public life by first asking, who is the doer, and what is the real self behind the role. Whether one leans toward Advaita’s nonduality, Vishishtadvaita’s devotional unity, or Dvaita’s reverent difference, the tradition insists that action becomes wise when ego loosens and dharma steadies. In this essay, inauguration is read as a ritual of rajadharma: a vow of service, a test of restraint, and a chance to convert ambition into yajna, work offered without clinging for common good.

## 1. What an inauguration really inaugurates

A modern inauguration is easy to treat as a spectacle: a stage, a crowd, a fixed camera angle, a phrase that will be replayed. Vedanta invites another view. A rite does not merely announce a new administration. It announces a new pattern of attention. It subtly trains the mind of a people to look in one direction, to fear in one direction, to hope in one direction, to interpret the world in one direction. In that sense, inauguration inaugurates a collective mind.

The Upanishads speak often of the direction of attention because attention decides experience. “As is one’s desire, so is one’s will; as is one’s will, so is one’s deed.” The teaching is not fatalism. It is a gentle warning that desires can become destinies, both for individuals and for nations. A second term, in particular, is thick with remembered desires: old promises, old disappointments, old enemies, old injuries, old adulations. The past returns, not only as history, but as samskara, the subtle impressions that incline the mind before it chooses.

An inauguration, then, has two doors. One door opens outward: the legal transfer of responsibility, the formal oath, the public words. The other opens inward: the renewal of a subtle contract between power and the psyche, between the role and the one who inhabits it. Vedanta cares about the second door because it knows how easily the role can swallow the person.

When the Gita describes action, it offers a phrase that seems almost political: “Established in yoga, perform action.” Yoga here is not posture; it is steadiness. It is the ability to act without being kidnapped by craving, anger, or fear. If an inauguration is a beginning, Vedanta asks, is it a beginning of steadiness, or a beginning of restlessness dressed as destiny?

## 2. Second term as return: the psychology of repetition

A second term is not merely a continuation. It is a return, and return has its own psychology. The mind returns to what it believes it did not finish. It returns to prove itself right. It returns to correct humiliation. It returns to protect an image. It returns to take revenge, or to consolidate a victory, or to secure a legacy. These are human motives, not unique to any era. Vedanta does not condemn motives; it diagnoses them.

The tradition repeatedly distinguishes between karma and karma-phala, action and its fruits. The problem is not action. The problem is bondage to the fruits. “Your right is to action alone, never to its fruits.” This single line is sometimes treated like a personal self-help maxim, but its depth is civic as well. If a leader is bound to outcomes as personal trophies, governance becomes theater. If a people are bound to outcomes as emotional narcotics, democracy becomes addiction.

A second term tends to intensify this binding. The story is already in the mind: what the first term meant, what it proved, what it failed to prove. The mind wants closure. Closure is a quiet desire for control, and control is often a disguised fear.

Vedanta’s antidote is not passivity. It is viveka, discrimination. The wise person distinguishes what can be controlled from what cannot, and then makes peace with the second while acting skillfully in the first. The wise nation tries to do the same: to accept uncertainty without panic, to pursue reform without intoxication, to defend its interests without demonizing its neighbors, internal or external.

A second term, therefore, can become either repetition or purification. Repetition means replaying samskara. Purification means noticing samskara, loosening it, and choosing anew.

## 3. Rajadharma: the old science of public duty

In Indian political thought, the phrase rajadharma does not mean merely “king’s law.” It means the moral ecology of power. Power is not neutral, because it amplifies the mind of the one who holds it. If the mind is compassionate, power becomes protection. If the mind is anxious, power becomes control. If the mind is angry, power becomes punishment. The Bhagavata and Mahabharata both treat the ruler as a magnifying lens: whatever is inside is projected outward.

Vedanta, especially in its practical side, is concerned with the inner discipline that prevents power from becoming a weapon against truth. The first discipline is satya, truthfulness, not as slogan but as integrity. Satya is the refusal to split reality into convenient fragments. A leader can spin narratives, but reality eventually returns as consequence. A citizen can consume narratives, but reality eventually returns as lived cost.

The second discipline is dama and shama, restraint of senses and mind. The modern world calls this “impulse control,” but the older term is more spiritual. Restraint is not repression. It is sovereignty. A leader without inner sovereignty will try to manufacture outer sovereignty through force. A people without inner sovereignty will demand entertainment from governance and will resent the slow work of institutions.

The third discipline is karuna, compassion. Compassion does not mean weak governance. It means seeing the human being before seeing the enemy, and seeing the long-term before seeing the short-term. The Upanishadic vision is radical: the same Self shines in all. Even if a state must oppose harmful actions, it need not annihilate the humanity of the one who errs. “The Self is the friend of the self, and the self is the enemy of the self.” The line is personal, yet it hints at a public truth: often the nation’s greatest threat is not an external rival, but its own inner fragmentation.

If inauguration is read as rajadharma, it becomes a vow to protect the vulnerable, to speak truth without cruelty, to restrain appetite, to steward wealth, and to guard the social fabric from the acid of contempt.

## 4. The oath as a sacred formula: speech and the power of vows

Vedanta takes speech seriously. Vedic culture treats speech, vac, as a creative force. Words shape perception, and perception shapes action. A vow is speech hardened into obligation. When a leader takes an oath, the public hears a legal sentence. Vedanta hears a mantra-like act: a binding of intention.

But a vow is meaningful only when the speaker remembers the source of speech. Where do words rise from? They rise from the mind, from buddhi, from a sense of self. If that sense of self is narrow, words become instruments. If that sense of self is wide, words become offerings.

In the inaugural address, phrases are chosen to awaken a mood: confidence, urgency, gratitude, defiance, reconciliation, aspiration. These moods are not trivial. They are the gunas at the civic scale. Sattva clarifies, rajas agitates, tamas dulls. Every political movement is, in part, a movement of gunas. A wise administration seeks policies that increase sattva in the body politic: transparency, education, health, fairness, procedural trust. A reckless administration feeds rajas and tamas: constant outrage, constant fear, constant contempt, constant distraction.

Vedanta’s question is simple: does the vow, and the speech around it, lift the guna balance toward clarity, or does it intensify agitation and dullness?

This is a spiritual diagnostic. Any leader, in any nation, can speak in ways that calm and clarify, or in ways that inflame and cloud.

## 5. The paradox of sovereignty: atman and nation

In political life, sovereignty is prized. Nations defend it; citizens argue over its meaning; leaders promise to restore it. Vedanta offers a paradox: the deepest sovereignty is inner. The atman is self-luminous, not dependent on applause. The more a person rests in that inner sovereignty, the less they need to dominate.

Yet nations cannot live only in contemplation. They must act. They must negotiate borders, laws, trade, security, welfare. How does Vedanta relate inner sovereignty to outer governance?

One way is to see the nation as an upadhi, a limiting adjunct. It is a useful form that channels responsibility, identity, and coordination. But it is not the ultimate self. When a citizen mistakes the nation for the ultimate self, politics becomes religion and opponents become demons. When a leader mistakes the office for the ultimate self, governance becomes ego.

Vedanta recommends a middle path. Love the nation as one loves a family, with loyalty and care, but do not absolutize it. The Gita’s vision is larger than tribe: “The wise see the same in a learned and humble person, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and one who eats dogs.” The point is not to erase differences; it is to dissolve hatred rooted in false separation.

A second term can intensify nationalism or purify it. It can turn sovereignty into siege mentality, or it can turn sovereignty into responsible self-rule that still recognizes shared humanity.

## 6. The return of karma: consequences as teachers

Vedanta is sometimes caricatured as otherworldly. In truth, it is intensely realist about consequences. Karma is not moral bookkeeping by a distant deity. It is the texture of cause and effect, including psychological cause and effect. Actions shape habits; habits shape character; character shapes destiny. The same is true of institutions.

When a second term begins, previous choices return as constraints and opportunities. Policies adopted earlier have created constituencies, dependencies, resentments, alliances. International partners have learned what to expect. Domestic agencies have been reshaped or resisted. The leader inherits not only a situation but also the karmic residue of prior governance.

In the Gita, Krishna often returns to the theme of consecrated action because consecration reduces karmic entanglement. If action is offered, not possessed, the mind is less entangled in outcome. This does not remove accountability. It removes obsession.

A nation too can practice a kind of consecration: to do what is needed for security and prosperity while resisting the intoxication of triumph. Triumph, when clung to, creates future backlash. Defeat, when clung to, creates bitterness. Vedanta does not promise a world without cycles. It promises a way to move through cycles without being broken.

## 7. Memory, grievance, and the fire of anger

In many second terms, the language of return contains the language of grievance. Grievance is memory mixed with anger. Anger is not always wrong; it can be a signal that something unjust occurred. But anger is dangerous when it becomes identity.

The Katha Upanishad offers an image of the chariot: the senses are horses, the mind is reins, the intellect is charioteer, the self is the lord of the chariot. When anger drives the horses, the chariot crashes, even if the destination is noble. A leader driven by grievance will often confuse vengeance with justice. A citizen driven by grievance will often confuse humiliation of the other with restoration of self-respect.

Vedanta proposes a discipline: recognize anger as a wave in the mind, not as the self. Do not suppress it, but do not worship it. Bring it into buddhi, into discernment. Ask, what is the just action here, and what is merely my need to feel powerful?

If a second term begins with unresolved anger, the administration may spend its energy settling scores. If it begins with transmuted anger, it may spend its energy reforming systems that created legitimate pain.

The difference is subtle and profound. One path produces endless enemies. The other produces institutional change.

## 8. The people as sadhakas: civic practice and inner discipline

Vedanta does not treat spirituality as private hobby. It treats spirituality as the training of attention, desire, and identity. In a democracy, citizens share responsibility for the tone of the collective mind. That means citizens are, in a sense, sadhakas together.

What is civic sadhana? It usually begins with shravana, listening. Not listening to propaganda, but listening to reality, including the reality of the other side’s fears. Then comes manana, reflection: weighing claims, checking sources, noticing one’s own emotional triggers. Then comes nididhyasana, deep assimilation: living from what one has understood, not merely knowing it.

A second term tests civic sadhana because it tends to polarize. Supporters feel vindicated; opponents feel threatened; moderates feel exhausted. Vedanta offers a practice for each:

For supporters: practice non-attachment to victory. Ask, can you support policies without idolizing a person? Can you criticize what is harmful without feeling disloyal? Can you celebrate without contempt?

For opponents: practice non-attachment to outrage. Ask, can you resist policies without dehumanizing voters? Can you critique without intoxicating your own anger? Can you propose alternatives, not only condemn?

For moderates: practice non-attachment to cynicism. Ask, can you stay engaged without pretending that nothing matters? Can you hold complexity without retreating into apathy?

In all three, the spiritual task is the same: to keep buddhi awake.

## 9. The two birds: witnessing and acting

One of Vedanta’s most famous images is the two birds on one tree: one bird eats the fruit, the other watches. The eating bird is the doer, tasting pleasure and pain. The watching bird is the witness, serene and free.

Public life needs both birds. The nation must eat fruits: budgets, policies, wars, treaties, taxes, laws. But if the nation forgets the witnessing bird, it becomes frantic. It begins to believe that the fruit is the self. That leads to desperation.

An inauguration, especially of a second term, is a moment to remember the witness. The role-holder must act, but can the role-holder also witness the role? Can the leader watch the urge for applause arise and pass? Can the leader watch fear arise and pass? Can the leader watch anger arise and pass? If so, leadership becomes less reactive.

Citizens too can cultivate the witness. Can you watch your nervous system respond to headlines, and then choose a calmer action? Can you watch your mind categorize people as enemies, and then choose a more human view? Can you watch your desire for simple stories, and then tolerate complexity?

The witness does not prevent action. It purifies action.

## 10. Wealth, desire, and the art of stewardship

Every inauguration includes economic imagination: promises of prosperity, jobs, investment, industry, innovation. Vedanta does not reject wealth. It places wealth within the purusharthas, the human aims: dharma, artha, kama, moksha. Wealth and desire are legitimate, but they become harmful when severed from dharma and moksha.

A second term often arrives with stronger economic claims, because the leader has learned what messaging mobilizes. The danger is that artha becomes the only song. If prosperity is pursued without ethics, it becomes exploitation. If prosperity is pursued without inner contentment, it becomes endless consumption. Both erode the soul of a nation.

Vedanta’s remedy is stewardship: treat wealth as a trust, not as a trophy. The Isa Upanishad offers a line often translated as “Enjoy through renunciation.” The meaning is not self-denial for its own sake. It is enjoyment without possession. It is abundance without greed.

Applied to policy, this suggests a preference for systems that reward innovation while protecting dignity, that encourage enterprise while discouraging predation, that measure success not only in markets but also in mental health, family stability, community trust, and ecological resilience.

A second term can amplify wealth inequality or correct it. Vedanta would judge not by rhetoric but by whether the weakest feel less disposable.

## 11. The danger of identification: office as mask

The Sanskrit tradition understands masks. It knows that the self can hide behind roles. The teacher, the monk, the householder, the ruler, the rebel, the saint, the cynic, all can become masks. The office of presidency is a powerful mask because it receives constant projection. Supporters project saviorhood; opponents project villainy. Both projections tempt the role-holder to become a character rather than a person.

Vedanta insists: you are not the mask. “Neti, neti,” not this, not this. The self is not the body, not the mood, not the reputation, not the office. The office is an upadhi. It can be used for service, but it cannot give lasting satisfaction.

A second term tests this because the mask has already been worn. The role-holder already knows the power of the mask, and the world already knows how to respond. The temptation is to lean into the mask more fully: to become pure performance.

The antidote is humility, not as public theater but as inner realism. Humility recognizes the limits of power. It recognizes that reality cannot be fully engineered. It recognizes that the world is complex, and that coercion has unintended consequences. Humility also recognizes the dignity of opponents, even while contesting their ideas.

The Gita’s vision of leadership is not soft. It is disciplined. It is the ability to hold power without being held by power.

## 12. Institutions as dharma: the subtle body of a nation

Vedanta speaks of the subtle body, the sukshma sharira, composed of mind, intellect, ego, and life forces. A nation also has a subtle body: its institutions, norms, procedures, habits of trust, civic rituals. These are not visible in one photo, but they determine whether the state can survive shocks.

In a second term, the relationship to institutions becomes critical. Some leaders see institutions as obstacles. Some see them as vessels. Vedanta would ask: do institutions protect dharma, or do they protect selfishness? The answer is usually mixed. Institutions can be captured. They can be corrupted. Yet institutions also prevent arbitrary power. They create continuity beyond personalities.

A Vedantic reading tends to value the impersonal. The impersonal is closer to sattva because it reduces ego-driven unpredictability. This does not mean institutions must never change. It means change should be guided by dharma, not by revenge.

The Mahabharata’s political wisdom often returns to counsel: do not destroy the bridge you will need tomorrow. Even if the bridge currently irritates you, burn it and you will fall into the river later. In modern terms: reforms should strengthen legitimacy, not weaken it.

A second term can either deepen institutional trust or rupture it. When trust ruptures, even good policies become suspicious. When trust deepens, even hard sacrifices can be shared.

## 13. Speech, media, and the ecology of truth

The inauguration era is also a media era. Words travel instantly. Half-truths travel faster. Outrage travels fastest. Vedanta would say: the mind is being constantly pulled outward. The senses are being stimulated. The reins are loose. The chariot is in danger.

Satya, as civic virtue, therefore requires training. Citizens must practice a kind of tapas, disciplined heat. Tapas is not only fasting from food; it is fasting from toxic information. It is choosing to verify before sharing, to slow down before judging, to read long form before reacting to clips.

Leaders too must practice tapas in speech. The temptation is to speak in a way that rewards the crowd immediately. But speech that feeds crowd emotion can poison the long-term. A leader can win a news cycle and lose social cohesion.

Vedanta suggests a simple standard: does this speech increase clarity and compassion? Or does it increase confusion and contempt? Clarity may still be firm. Compassion may still be decisive. But neither needs cruelty.

A second term can be remembered as a renaissance of truthfulness or as an avalanche of distortion. The difference often lies not in policy complexity but in the emotional tone of speech.

## 14. Foreign relations: seeing the other without losing the self

Every administration faces foreign partners and rivals. Here Vedanta offers an especially useful principle: the other is not unreal. Nonduality does not deny difference; it denies hatred rooted in absolute separation. The wise person, and the wise nation, sees the other clearly.

A second term often begins with strong signals to the world. Allies wonder what will continue, what will change. Rivals test boundaries. Markets react. Diplomats interpret. In such a climate, reactive decisions can spiral.

Vedanta recommends steadiness. Steadiness does not mean weakness. It means not being driven by fear or vanity. A nation can defend itself without worshiping conflict. It can pursue advantage without humiliating partners. It can negotiate hard without making every disagreement a moral apocalypse.

The Gita’s counsel to Arjuna is relevant here: fight when duty requires, but fight without hatred. Modern diplomacy is not battlefield archery, yet the principle stands: do what is necessary, but do not let necessity become cruelty.

A second term that treats every partner as enemy will isolate itself. A second term that treats every partner as friend will be naive. Vedantic steadiness seeks dharmic realism.

## 15. The sacrament of work: yajna and governance

One of the most practical Vedantic ideas for public life is yajna, sacrifice as mutual nourishment. In the Gita, Krishna describes a cycle: beings live by food, food by rain, rain by sacrifice, sacrifice by action. The point is interdependence. When action becomes sacrifice, society flourishes. When action becomes extraction, society decays.

Governance is, at its best, yajna. Taxes are collected, services are provided, infrastructure is built, justice is administered, security is maintained. The cycle depends on trust. If citizens believe that the state is extracting without offering, they resist. If the state believes citizens are selfish, it coerces. The cycle breaks.

A second term is a chance to repair the yajna cycle. It is a chance to rebuild trust, transparency, and reciprocity. It is also a temptation to exploit the cycle: to reward loyalists, punish dissenters, and treat institutions as spoils. Vedanta calls this adharma.

The Vedantic test is straightforward: are policies guided by the welfare of the whole, or by the enlargement of a factional ego? The welfare of the whole does not mean pleasing everyone. It means not turning governance into a private revenge engine.

## 16. The inner meaning of “golden age”

In inaugural rhetoric, phrases like “golden age” appear to energize. Vedanta would ask: what is truly golden? Gold, in spiritual metaphor, is purity that does not tarnish. In the mind, the golden quality is sattva: clarity, calm, discernment, compassion, joy without addiction.

A nation can increase material wealth and still become spiritually poor, if citizens become lonely, angry, and distrustful. A nation can endure hardship and still remain spiritually rich, if citizens maintain solidarity, meaning, and inner freedom. Ideally, both material and spiritual health grow together.

So if an administration declares a golden age, Vedanta interprets it as a challenge: will policies increase sattva, or only increase consumption? Will the culture become more truthful, more kind, more stable, more wise? Or will it become more frantic, more divided, more performative?

A second term can either mature into quiet competence or inflate into grandiosity. Quiet competence is closer to sattva. Grandiosity is usually rajas.

## 17. The problem of ego: “I alone will fix it”

Vedanta’s central diagnosis of suffering is avidya, ignorance, especially the ignorance that mistakes the limited ego for the whole self. In politics, avidya often takes the form of savior fantasies, both for leaders and for followers. A leader can believe, “I alone will fix it.” A follower can believe, “Only this person can save us.” Both beliefs are spiritually dangerous and civically fragile.

Vedanta’s alternative is shared dharma. The leader has a role, but the leader is not the nation. The citizen has a role, but the citizen is not powerless. Institutions exist, communities exist, families exist, inner conscience exists. When a nation distributes responsibility wisely, it is resilient.

A second term can feed savior mythology or dismantle it. Dismantling it does not mean disrespect for leadership. It means sober realism: progress requires many hands and many years. No single election can substitute for ongoing ethical labor.

Vedanta would therefore advise citizens: admire strengths, criticize harms, but do not worship. Worship belongs to the ultimate. Politics is not ultimate.

## 18. Polarization as maya: illusion of absolute separation

Maya is often misunderstood as “the world is fake.” Vedanta’s more careful teaching is that maya is the tendency to mistake partial perception for total reality, to absolutize what is relative. Polarization is a civic form of maya. It turns complex persons into one-dimensional caricatures. It turns policy disputes into cosmic battles. It turns neighbor into enemy.

A second term can heighten this maya because the story becomes binary: the return is either redemption or catastrophe. The truth is usually mixed. Some policies will help, some will harm, some will have unintended consequences. The wise mind holds nuance.

How does one pierce polarization? Vedanta suggests a practice: see the Self in the other, even while disagreeing. This does not mean surrendering principles. It means refusing hatred as a habit.

In practical terms, it means protecting speech rights even for opponents, protecting due process even when angry, protecting minority rights even when majorities are impatient. It means remembering that power rotates. Today’s victor can be tomorrow’s outcast. Dharma protects all by being impersonal.

## 19. The citizen’s vow: a parallel inauguration

If the leader takes an oath, the citizen can take an inner oath. Not a legal oath, but a spiritual vow. A second term is a convenient time to renew civic vows because attention is already focused.

A Vedantic civic vow could sound like this:

I will seek truth before sharing claims.
I will criticize policies without dehumanizing people.
I will resist corruption even when it benefits my side.
I will practice restraint in speech and consumption.
I will support institutions that protect fairness and dignity.
I will remember that my deepest identity is not partisan.
I will serve my community.

Such vows are not naive. They are practical. They reduce the heat of rajas and increase the light of sattva.

When many citizens take such vows, politics becomes less toxic, regardless of who holds office.

## 20. A Vedantic reading of power’s impermanence

Inauguration feels monumental, yet Vedanta whispers: all forms are impermanent. Offices change hands. Bodies age. Public moods shift. Alliances dissolve. What remains? The witness remains. The Self remains. Brahman remains.

This teaching is not meant to belittle civic life. It is meant to free civic life from hysteria. If everything is ultimate, nothing is. When citizens believe the whole universe depends on one leader, they become anxious and reactive. When citizens remember impermanence, they can act firmly without losing inner peace.

The Buddha said that all conditioned things are impermanent. Vedanta agrees, while also insisting that there is an unconditioned ground. The unconditioned does not cancel the conditioned; it dignifies it. It allows action to be sane.

A second term, then, should be met with seriousness and also with spiritual proportion. Seriousness because consequences matter. Proportion because the mind must not be destroyed by attachment.

## 21. The leader’s sadhana: five inner disciplines for the second term

From a Vedantic angle, the beginning of a second term invites inner discipline, not as branding, but as sanity.

1. Daily silence: a short interval with no performance, only witnessing.
2. Truth tellers nearby: people permitted to disagree without fear.
3. Restraint in speech: fewer impulsive declarations, more measured language.
4. Compassion as a filter: ask who is harmed, and reduce avoidable harm.
5. Non-attachment to legacy: act for dharma now, not for applause later.

These disciplines do not guarantee political victory. They protect the mind from captivity.

## 22. The deeper inauguration: from power to presence

The most radical Vedantic claim is that liberation is possible here and now, in the midst of action. The world does not need to become perfect for the mind to become free. This is why a Vedantic reading of inauguration matters. It reminds us that the deepest change is not only policy change, but consciousness change.

A leader can hold power and still be free if the leader does not cling. A citizen can oppose power and still be free if the citizen does not hate. A nation can prosper and still be free if it does not worship consumption. A nation can suffer and still be free if it does not collapse into despair.

The inauguration of a second term is therefore also an invitation to inaugurate a second way of seeing: to see roles as roles, to see opponents as human, to see institutions as dharma-tools, to see wealth as stewardship, to see speech as sacred, to see impermanence as relief, to see the Self as the ground.

## Conclusion: the quiet test after the loud ceremony

The cameras eventually turn away. The crowd disperses. The headlines shift to the first executive actions, the first disputes, the first crises. What remains is the quiet test: how will power be used, and how will the nation’s mind respond?

Vedanta does not predict outcomes. It offers a compass. It asks leaders and citizens to cultivate sattva, to act with non-attachment, to restrain the ego, to honor dharma, and to remember the witness.

If a second term begins with that remembrance, even difficult policies can be carried with dignity. If it begins without that remembrance, even good intentions can become harmful through pride and anger.

In the end, the most valuable record is not only the archival record of speeches and signatures. It is the inner record written in character: how a nation learned, or failed to learn, to see itself in truth for us together.
