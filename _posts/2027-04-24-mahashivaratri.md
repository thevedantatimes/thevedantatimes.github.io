# Shivaratri Markandeya: Meeting Death With Nondual Awareness

## Two kinds of wakefulness on Shivaratri

Mahashivaratri is a night of wakefulness. On the surface it is a vigil: lamps, mantras, stories, and the steady rhythm of remembrance. Beneath the surface it is a deeper wakefulness: waking up from the trance of fear, especially the fear of time and death. Among the Shivaratri legends, the story of Markandeya stands like a lamp in a storm. It does not deny mortality. It teaches how to meet mortality without losing the center. It turns darkness into a teacher of peace.

The legend is not only about a boy saved from death. It is about awareness saved from identification. Fear of death is often fear of losing "me." Vedanta asks: what exactly is this "me"? Is it the body, the roles, the memories, the breath? Or is it the witnessing presence that knows all these changes? Shivaratri invites an honest experiment: shift identity from the perishable to the imperishable. When this shift matures, fear loosens, and the heart learns to live with tenderness, urgency, and truth.

## The legend: a young life at the edge of time

In many tellings, Markandeya is destined to live only a short span. His parents grieve even before loss arrives. The child grows into a seeker whose love for Shiva becomes his breath. When the appointed time comes, the lord of death appears to claim what is due. Markandeya does not argue with death. He clings to the Shiva linga and surrenders. Shiva manifests, interrupts the claim, and reveals a truth: the devotee who rests in the Real is not a possession of time.

Read outwardly, the story is miraculous protection. Read inwardly, it is an instruction: when fear of death rises, cling not to panic, but to stillness. Hold the linga of awareness. Let the mind’s drama meet the unmoving center.

This is not escapism. It is a training in perspective.

## Time as Kala: the great hypnotist

In Shiva traditions, Kala is not merely clock time. Kala is the force of change. It is the relentless movement that turns youth to age, certainty to uncertainty, possession to loss. The mind often experiences Kala as a threat because the mind is built to preserve continuity. The ego loves "my story." Time threatens the story.

Vedanta says something radical: the Self is not inside time. Time appears in the Self. Change is known by awareness, but awareness is not changed by change. The Mandukya Upanishad hints at a fourth dimension, turiya, that is not the waking state, not the dream state, not deep sleep, but the steady reality in which all states arise and subside.

Fear of time often decreases when you taste turiya even briefly.

A short contemplation:
- Thoughts change.
- Sensations change.
- Emotions change.
- Even the sense of "I am this person" changes.
- Yet there is something that knows the change.
- That knowing presence is steady.

Shivaratri is a night to return to that steadiness.

## Markandeya and Nachiketa: two faces of the same lesson

The Katha Upanishad tells of Nachiketa, a boy who goes to Yama and refuses shallow gifts. He wants the knowledge of what remains when the body falls. Yama tests him with pleasures and power. Nachiketa insists on truth. Yama finally teaches that the Self is unborn and cannot be slain.

Markandeya and Nachiketa are two mirrors. Nachiketa asks death a question. Markandeya meets death with surrender. One is inquiry, the other is devotion. Both lead to the same recognition: the Self is beyond death.

Shivaratri can hold both.
- Ask: "Who am I, really?"
- Surrender: "Let my false identity dissolve."

Inquiry and surrender are not enemies. They are two hands of the same awakening.

## Surrender: what it is and what it is not

In spiritual language, surrender can be misunderstood.

Surrender is not:
- resignation to injustice
- passivity in the face of harm
- refusal to feel grief
- denial of responsibility

Surrender is:
- releasing the compulsive need to control outcomes
- releasing the belief that you are only the body-mind
- offering the fruits of action to the divine
- trusting the deeper order of dharma

Markandeya’s surrender is not a bargain with Shiva. It is an identity shift. He clings to the linga not as an object of superstition, but as a symbol of the unshaken center.

## The linga as a symbol of the unmoving witness

The Shiva linga is often described as formless form, a sign of the infinite. For inward practice it can symbolize the witness: the simple presence that remains when thoughts whirl.

When you "cling to the linga" inwardly, you do three things:
1. You return attention to the present moment.
2. You stop feeding catastrophic stories.
3. You rest as the witness of sensation and thought.

This is the inner ritual. It can be done anywhere: at a hospital bedside, in a sleepless night, in the middle of a panic wave. You are training the nervous system to remember the ground.

## The fear of death: what is it made of?

Fear of death is rarely only fear of a physical event. It often includes:
- fear of pain
- fear of separation from loved ones
- fear of unfinished life
- fear of losing identity and control
- fear of meaninglessness

Vedanta does not dismiss these fears. It refines them. It asks: what is the meaning of life if it ends? And then it answers from a deeper place: life has meaning because the Self is meaning. The Self is not a future promise; it is the present reality.

A helpful approach is to meet fear in layers.

### Layer 1: body fear
The body wants safety. Offer the body care: sleep, food, medical attention, rest.

### Layer 2: mind fear
The mind wants certainty. Offer the mind discernment: see what you know and what you imagine.

### Layer 3: ego fear
The ego wants permanence. Offer the ego surrender: let the story loosen.

### Layer 4: existential fear
The heart wants meaning. Offer the heart devotion: remember the Real.

Markandeya’s legend holds all layers at once.

## Nondual awareness: the shift from object to subject

Nondual awareness is not a new experience to acquire. It is the recognition of what is always present: the subject, awareness itself. In ordinary life we live as objects: "I am this body," "I am this role," "I am these thoughts." Vedanta points to the subject: the awareness that knows body, role, thought.

This shift can be described simply:
- Instead of "I am afraid," try "fear is present."
- Instead of "I am dying," try "the body is changing."
- Instead of "I am losing everything," try "experience is changing in awareness."

This is not cold detachment. It is intimacy without drowning. It allows love and grief to exist without collapsing into panic.

## A gentle teaching on the three bodies

Vedanta often describes three layers: gross body, subtle body (mind, senses, prana), and causal body (seed tendencies). Death affects the gross body. The mind also changes, and its patterns carry forward. But awareness, the witness, is deeper than these layers.

Whether one interprets rebirth literally or symbolically, the practical point is the same: you are not reducible to the body. You are the knower of the body.

Shivaratri practice is to locate yourself as the knower.

## Meeting loss: grief as love in motion

Sometimes fear of death is fear of grief. When we love, we become vulnerable. Vedanta does not advise closing the heart. It advises knowing the ground while the heart opens.

Grief can be understood as love that has nowhere to go. If you respect grief, it becomes purification. If you resist grief, it becomes bitterness. If you spiritualize grief too quickly, it becomes numbness.

Markandeya teaches a balanced way:
- Feel what you feel.
- Hold it in the witness.
- Offer it to Shiva.
- Continue living dharmically.

This is not bypass. It is integration.

## Practices for Shivaratri: meeting death with steadiness

### Practice 1: Ten breaths at the doorway

When fear rises, do not immediately seek distraction. Sit and take ten slow breaths. Lengthen the exhale. Feel the belly. Let the shoulders drop. On each exhale, repeat silently: "Let go." On each inhale, repeat: "Here."

This practice trains the body to trust the present.

### Practice 2: Neti neti, softly

Neti neti means "not this, not this." It is a gentle process of disidentification.

- I am not only this body.
- I am not only these thoughts.
- I am not only this emotion.
- I am the awareness in which they appear.

Do not force belief. Taste it. Even a small taste changes fear.

### Practice 3: The Markandeya vow

Choose a short vow for the week:
- I will meet fear with presence.
- I will not feed catastrophic stories.
- I will practice one act of surrender daily.

Write it. Keep it visible. Repeat it at night.

### Practice 4: Mantra as the rope of steadiness

Choose a Shiva mantra and repeat it steadily. The point is not performance. The point is rhythm. Rhythm calms the mind. Calm reveals the witness.

A simple refrain:
"Om Namah Shivaya."
Let it become breath. Let it become silence.

## The dharma of living: death contemplation is not morbid

In many traditions, contemplation of death is a way to sharpen life. It removes triviality. It exposes what matters. When you remember impermanence, you stop postponing love and practice.

Ask:
- If I had one year, how would I live?
- If I had one month, what would I forgive?
- If I had one day, what would I offer?

This contemplation is not to frighten the mind. It is to purify priorities.

Markandeya’s story is a teaching about urgency without panic.

## The paradox: Shiva interrupts death by revealing the timeless

The outward miracle is Shiva stopping Yama. The inward miracle is awareness stopping identification. When identification stops, death loses its tyranny. The body may still die, relationships may still change, but the Self is recognized as untouched.

A Gita-flavored reminder often paraphrased in devotion:
- what is real does not cease
- what ceases was never the whole truth

This is the heart of nondual courage.

## Modern faces of Yama: anxiety, obsession, avoidance

In our era, Yama appears in subtle forms:
- health anxiety that consumes attention
- obsession with longevity as a substitute for meaning
- avoidance of aging, silence, and solitude
- compulsive productivity to outrun emptiness

These are not moral failures. They are strategies of fear. Markandeya teaches a different strategy: rest in the linga of awareness.

A practical modern vow:
- I will not research symptoms late at night.
- I will not scroll to numb grief.
- I will take care of the body and also remember the Self.

Care and remembrance can coexist.

## A guided contemplation: standing at the edge, resting in the center

Try this contemplation during Shivaratri or any quiet evening:

1. Sit comfortably. Bring attention to breath.
2. Imagine standing at the edge of life, looking back with kindness.
3. Notice what feels unfinished. Let it be.
4. Ask, "What remains even when everything changes?"
5. Sense the quiet awareness that knows images and feelings.
6. Rest there, without forcing.
7. Offer a simple prayer: "May I live with integrity. May I die with clarity."

This contemplation is not a rehearsal of doom. It is a rehearsal of freedom.

## The ethics of spiritual power: why dharma matters here

Nondual talk can be misused: "If the Self is beyond death, nothing matters." That is not Vedanta. Vedanta integrates knowledge with dharma. The mind must be purified to recognize the Self steadily. Ethics is not decoration. Ethics is preparation.

Markandeya’s devotion is not a license to ignore life. It is a call to live cleanly:
- tell the truth
- practice non-harm
- keep commitments
- serve where you can
- reduce unnecessary consumption
- make time for silence

These are practical ways to loosen the ego’s grip.

## Seven days after Shivaratri: a plan for fear-to-freedom

**Day 1: Presence**
- Ten-breath practice twice.
- One page of scripture or a devotional hymn.

**Day 2: Disidentification**
- Neti neti for five minutes.
- Write: "What am I beyond roles?"

**Day 3: Care**
- Do one health-supportive action without obsession.
- Walk mindfully for twenty minutes.

**Day 4: Love**
- Speak one gratitude you have postponed.
- Forgive one small grievance.

**Day 5: Surrender**
- Offer one worry to Shiva in prayer.
- Stop one compulsive reassurance habit for a day.

**Day 6: Meaning**
- Do one act of service.
- Simplify one cluttered space.

**Day 7: Silence**
- Sit for twenty minutes, rest as witness.
- End with a vow: "May I remember what is timeless."

Consistency matters more than intensity.

## Shiva as Mrityunjaya: the conqueror of fear, not a denial of death

Many devotees chant the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra, often called the "great death-conquering mantra." It is frequently translated as a prayer to be released from bondage the way a ripe fruit is released from its stem. The deeper meaning is worth pausing over: the prayer is not necessarily "let my body never die." The prayer is "let my awareness be free, let my clinging fall away, let my fear dissolve."

Shiva as Mrityunjaya is the principle that reveals the deathless. Inwardly, Mrityu is not only the final event. Mrityu is the small deaths of ego: the death of control, the death of identity, the death of certainty. These happen daily. Each time we can release clinging, we taste the deathless.

A practical Mrityunjaya reflection:
- What am I clinging to as if it must remain?
- What fear rises when I imagine it changing?
- Can I hold the fear and still let go a little?

This is how "conquering death" becomes a daily sadhana.

## The three fears behind the fear of death

When you listen closely, fear of death often has three main roots.

1. **Fear of pain**: "Will it hurt?"
2. **Fear of separation**: "Will I lose those I love?"
3. **Fear of nothingness**: "Will I vanish?"

Vedanta meets each with a different medicine.

### Medicine for fear of pain: compassion for the body
Take care of the body. Seek help. Use medicine wisely. Vedanta is not anti-care. It is anti-obsession. Pain is real at the level of the body-mind. The path is not to deny pain but to meet it with presence. Presence does not erase pain, but it reduces the secondary suffering of panic.

### Medicine for fear of separation: love that is not ownership
Separation hurts because love is real. But much suffering comes from turning love into possession. Vedanta teaches that love can be wide without becoming grasping. The more we let love become blessing rather than control, the less separation becomes a collapse of identity.

A simple prayer:
"May those I love be protected. And may my love not become a chain."

### Medicine for fear of nothingness: tasting awareness now
Nothingness is frightening when we believe our identity is the story of a person. Nondual awareness reveals that your deepest identity is not an object in the story. It is the luminous knowing in which the story appears. Awareness is not nothing. It is the condition for everything you have ever known.

This is why practice matters. Philosophy alone rarely dissolves existential fear. Direct tasting dissolves it.

## The sleep analogy: why deep sleep is a quiet teacher

A classic Vedantic pointer uses sleep. Each night, the mind dissolves into deep sleep. The personal story pauses. Yet on waking we say, "I slept well." Who knew that? The tradition uses this to point to a deeper continuity.

Deep sleep does not prove metaphysical claims by itself. But it does show a lived truth: the ego is not the only mode of existence. There is a dimension of being that can rest without personal narrative. When you contemplate death, you can use this analogy gently: death is not the same as sleep, yet sleep hints that the story is not the whole of you.

Shivaratri vigil is also a twist on this teaching. Instead of letting the mind collapse into sleep, we remain awake and discover the stillness that sleep usually provides. We find the deep-sleep peace while conscious. That is a taste of liberation.

## The five sheaths: refining identification

Another Vedantic model speaks of five sheaths, from gross to subtle. The practice of meeting death with awareness is largely the practice of loosening identification with these sheaths.

- **Food sheath**: body, built from nourishment.
- **Vital sheath**: prana, energy, breath.
- **Mental sheath**: thoughts, emotions, images.
- **Intellectual sheath**: discernment, belief, identity structures.
- **Bliss sheath**: subtle rest and contentment in deep absorption.

The witness knows all sheaths. Death affects the outer layers. The witness remains.

A practical contemplation:
"Body is known. Breath is known. Thought is known. Belief is known. Even peace is known. I am the knower."

Repeat slowly. Let it be felt.

## Surrender and effort: a mature balance

Some seekers lean too much into surrender and neglect discipline. Others lean too much into effort and neglect grace. Markandeya’s legend suggests a mature balance: he practices devotion, and he surrenders at the moment of truth.

In practice:
- do your part with integrity
- accept what you cannot control
- offer the outcome to Shiva

This balance reduces fear because it ends the fantasy that you must manage everything.

A short formula:
"Effort in action, surrender in outcome, awareness in experience."

## How fear becomes a storm: the anatomy of panic

Many people experience death anxiety as panic. A small sensation appears, the mind interprets it as danger, the body releases adrenaline, the sensation increases, the mind becomes more convinced, and the cycle accelerates. This is not weakness. It is physiology plus interpretation.

The Markandeya practice interrupts the cycle at two points:
- the body: slow exhale, grounding, softness in muscles
- the mind: disidentification, returning to the witness, refusing catastrophic narrative

A grounding sequence you can memorize:
- look around and name five objects
- feel the weight of the body on the chair
- exhale slowly, longer than inhale
- say silently, "This is fear, not certainty"
- return to a mantra for one minute

Panic often passes when it is not fed.

## The courage to speak of death: healing avoidance

Many families avoid speaking of death. Avoidance increases fear because it makes death feel like a taboo monster. Speaking gently about death can reduce fear and increase care.

A Shivaratri conversation practice:
- Ask elders about their wishes.
- Write a simple document of preferences.
- Share love without postponing.

These acts are not gloomy. They are compassionate.

Markandeya teaches that facing death can deepen life.

## Dharma at the edge: living so that death feels simpler

A clean conscience makes death simpler. This is not superstition. It is psychology and spirituality aligned. When you lie, betray, exploit, or carry unresolved harm, the mind becomes noisy. When you live with integrity, the mind becomes lighter.

Shivaratri is a time to refine dharma in three areas:

1. **Speech**: less harshness, fewer lies, fewer exaggerations.
2. **Action**: more responsibility, less avoidance.
3. **Intention**: more service, less self-display.

You do not need perfection. You need direction.

## Markandeya’s posture: clinging to the linga as clinging to truth

Some readers misunderstand the legend as "cling to Shiva and you will escape consequences." The inward reading is more subtle: cling to truth and you will be freed from bondage, even if circumstances change.

Truth here has three layers:
- the truth of facts: what is happening now
- the truth of values: what is right action
- the truth of being: awareness is the ground

When you cling to these truths, you are not shaken easily.

## A deeper inquiry: who is afraid?

When fear arises, ask, "Who is afraid?" The mind will answer: "I am afraid." Ask again: "Who is this I?" Do not force an intellectual answer. Look in direct experience.

- Is the fear in the body? Then the body is an object.
- Is the fear in thought? Then thought is an object.
- Is the fear in a story of future? Then story is an object.

Who knows the object? That knower is not the object. The knower is awareness.

Rest there, even briefly. Fear loosens when the knower is recognized.

## Compassionate devotion: Shiva as the heart’s refuge

While inquiry clarifies, devotion softens. Devotion turns the heart toward what is larger than the personal story. In Shiva bhakti, this larger reality is often felt as protective, luminous, and intimate.

Try this simple bhakti practice:
- Place the palm on the heart.
- Inhale and whisper inwardly, "Shiva."
- Exhale and whisper inwardly, "I trust."
- Continue for fifty breaths.

Trust here is not blind belief. It is the willingness to relax the grip of control.

## Living with death as a companion: impermanence without despair

Impermanence can produce despair when we think meaning depends on permanence. Vedanta flips that. Meaning is discovered in the Real, and the Real is present now. Impermanence then becomes a teacher of simplicity.

A practical way to live with impermanence:
- enjoy without clinging
- love without owning
- serve without needing credit
- practice without bargaining

This is a mature heart.

## Ritual guidance: Shivaratri abhishekam as dissolving fear

If you do abhishekam, pouring water or milk on the linga, add an inner meaning:
- each pour is a surrender of one fear
- each pour is a cleansing of one attachment
- each pour is an offering of one identity

Name the fear silently and pour it out. Then sit. Let silence receive you.

Fear is often tightness. Abhishekam becomes a ritual of softening.

## A 21-day plan: from death anxiety to steady awareness

If you want a longer training, try this 21-day sequence.

**Days 1-7: Regulation**
- Twice daily, ten slow breaths with long exhale.
- One walk without phone.
- Reduce stimulating media at night.

**Days 8-14: Disidentification**
- Daily neti neti for five minutes.
- Journal one paragraph: "What am I beyond roles?"
- Notice fear stories, label them "future story."

**Days 15-21: Integration**
- Daily mantra for ten minutes.
- One act of service each day.
- One honest conversation you have avoided.

This plan weaves body, mind, and heart. It is Markandeya practice for modern life.

## When death arrives near: how to use the teaching with tenderness

Sometimes this teaching is needed because someone is ill or because grief is present now. In those moments, do not use nonduality as a hammer. Use it as a blanket. Be tender.

- Sit with the person. Breathe together.
- Repeat a simple mantra softly.
- Offer touch if welcomed.
- Say what is true and kind: "I am here."
- Let tears come. Tears are not failure. Tears are love.

Awareness does not cancel love. Awareness holds love.

## Markandeya as "eternal youth": beginner mind and fresh devotion

In some retellings, Markandeya is described as blessed with long life, even "ever-youthful." Read inwardly, this does not have to mean a frozen body. It can mean a fresh mind. The ego becomes old quickly. It collects conclusions, grudges, and identities. It repeats yesterday’s reactions. A youthful mind is different. It meets each moment with openness and humility.

This is a powerful antidote to death fear. Much fear is the mind’s habit of rehearsing loss. A fresh mind returns to the present and says, "Right now I am breathing. Right now I can love. Right now I can practice."

Cultivating this "eternal youth" is simple:
- begin each morning with a short prayer
- begin each conversation with listening
- begin each practice session as if it is the first
- forgive quickly, so you do not carry heavy time

Shivaratri is a yearly reminder to renew the heart. Markandeya becomes the symbol of renewed devotion.

## The chain that creates suffering: from desire to delusion

The Bhagavad Gita gives a causal chain that is especially relevant for death anxiety. When the mind clings to objects and outcomes, it breeds desire. When desire is blocked, it breeds anger. When anger dominates, discernment becomes cloudy, and the mind forgets the deeper Self. In modern terms: anxious attachment to outcomes produces the very fear we try to avoid.

If you want to soften death fear, look at attachment in daily life.
- Are you attached to being admired?
- Are you attached to being in control?
- Are you attached to certainty?
- Are you attached to having life go a particular way?

Each attachment becomes a small rehearsal of death fear: the fear of losing.

A gentle practice is to release one attachment each week. Choose something mild at first.
- let someone else choose the restaurant
- allow an email to wait without immediate reassurance
- accept being misunderstood for a moment without correcting
- leave a task imperfect when perfection is a form of control

These releases are small deaths of ego. Each one trains nondual courage.

## The witness in action: nonduality is not only on the cushion

Many people taste witness consciousness in meditation and lose it in traffic, conflict, or deadlines. Markandeya’s teaching becomes powerful when applied in motion.

Try this micro-practice three times a day:
- Stop for ten seconds.
- Feel the body.
- Notice one thought.
- Notice the awareness that knows the thought.
- Continue your activity while remembering that awareness.

This is living nonduality. It is not dramatic. It is steady.

Over time, the witness becomes a companion. Then death fear changes. It may still arise, but it no longer feels like a total takeover.

## Writing a letter to Yama: a practical method for honesty and surrender

Here is an unusual but effective practice. Write a short letter to Yama, the lord of death. Be honest.

- What do you fear most?
- What do you feel unfinished about?
- What do you wish you had said?
- What do you regret?
- What do you love?

Then write a reply from the perspective of dharma:
- What can you do now, while time is available?
- What forgiveness can you offer now?
- What apology can you make now?
- What simple practice can you begin now?

This transforms death contemplation into life refinement. Markandeya’s story becomes your own path.

## The middle way: neither obsession with death nor denial of death

Some people cope with fear by denial: pretending death will not arrive. Others cope by obsession: constant research, constant checking, constant rumination. Vedanta offers a middle way: remember death enough to live wisely, and remember the Self enough to live peacefully.

A simple balance:
- Once a week, reflect on impermanence for five minutes.
- Each day, rest as awareness for five minutes.
- Each day, do one act of love.

The heart becomes steady.

## The gift of Shivaratri night: meeting darkness as sacred

Shivaratri happens in darkness. Darkness can symbolize ignorance, fear, and the unknown. Yet on this night, darkness is not the enemy. Darkness becomes sacred space. Inwardly, this is the teaching: the unknown does not have to be frightening when awareness is present.

Sit in a dim room for ten minutes. Let the mind feel the unknown. Then return to breath and mantra. You are training trust. Trust is not belief about the future. Trust is intimacy with the present.

Markandeya’s legend becomes a guide for the dark.

## A final prayer and a final inquiry

Before closing your Shivaratri practice, hold these two lines together, like two eyes.

**Prayer**: "Shiva, let me release what I cannot hold. Let my heart be clean."
**Inquiry**: "What is aware of this prayer, this fear, this love?"

Prayer softens the heart. Inquiry clarifies the mind. When both are present, nondual awareness is not dry, and devotion is not blind. The heart becomes brave and tender at once.

If fear returns tomorrow, do not judge it. Return to the practice. Ten breaths. One mantra. One look into the witness. The path is made of returns.

## Service as immortality: letting love outlive the ego

A hidden root of death fear is the feeling that our life does not matter. One antidote is simple: let your life bless others. When you serve, you taste a kind of immortality, not in the body, but in meaning. Service reduces the ego’s obsession with its own survival because attention moves outward into care.

Choose one small service in the Markandeya spirit:
- check on an elder
- help a neighbor without announcing it
- donate quietly to ease someone’s burden
- teach a child something wholesome
- forgive a debt of resentment

These actions do not erase mortality. They make mortality luminous.

In the end, Markandeya’s teaching is simple: do not wait for death to teach you the Self. Learn the Self now, in small daily recognitions, and then death becomes a passage within awareness, not a collapse of awareness.

## Closing: the fearless heart is not future, it is present

Markandeya’s gift is not the promise of endless youth. It is the discovery of the timeless within the changing. The body may be claimed by time, but awareness is not owned by time. When you cling to the Shiva linga inwardly, you cling to the center that cannot be taken.

On Shivaratri, let the night teach you this: fear is a visitor, not a ruler. Time is a river, not your identity. Death is a doorway, not an annihilation of the Real. Live with care. Love without delay. Practice with steadiness. And rest, again and again, as the awareness that witnesses all change.

"Om Namah Shivaya."
