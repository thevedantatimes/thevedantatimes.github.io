“Everything is Brahman.”  
For many spiritual seekers, this insight lands like a bolt of lightning—liberating, elegant, and final. And then, almost immediately, a practical question rises up and refuses to go away:

If Brahman is the only reality, and nothing can stick to Brahman, what happens to karma?  
Who is responsible? Who is rewarded or punished? Does morality dissolve into philosophy?

This question is not a small technicality. It touches the foundation of ethical life, the meaning of spiritual practice, and the credibility of non-dual teachings. If the answer is vague, spirituality risks becoming an excuse. If the answer is sharp, it becomes a powerful bridge between absolute truth and everyday living.

Let’s build that bridge carefully.

## 1) What Karma Means in Ordinary Life

In the Indian spiritual traditions—Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh—the law of karma is one of the most widely shared assumptions, even among schools that disagree on God, the soul, or the nature of liberation.

At its simplest, karma means this:

**Actions have consequences.**

Not only in the external sense (“if I touch fire, I get burned”), but also in a moral-psychological sense:

- **Ethical action** tends to produce **merit** and supportive outcomes—peace, clarity, harmony, well-being.
- **Unethical action** tends to produce **demerit** and painful outcomes—disturbance, guilt, conflict, suffering.

This is not merely a cosmic scoreboard. It includes the obvious effects of behavior: trust broken, relationships damaged, habits strengthened, or conscience burdened. But it also includes a subtler claim: that the moral texture of action leaves impressions which mature into future experiences.

Now, karma needs an “owner.” Karma only makes sense if there is a being who feels:

> “I did this.”

That sense of “I am the doer” is the psychological anchor of karma. When it is strong, the results of action feel personal and binding. When it weakens, the grip of karma loosens.

So far, karma seems completely natural. We live in it every day. We feel it in regret, in pride, in fear, in hope, in responsibility.

Then Advaita arrives and says:

**You are not the doer you think you are.**

And that is where the tension begins.

## 2) The Advaita Shock: The Doer Is Not Ultimate

The Mandukya Upanishad (and Advaita more broadly) points beyond the everyday identity—the waking person who plans, works, succeeds, fails, feels good or guilty.

It says: you are not ultimately the waking individual.

You are the reality that illumines the waking state, the dream state, and the deep sleep state. You are the background awareness in which all of them appear.

This is often called **Turiyam** (the “fourth,” though it is not another state alongside the other three). Turiyam is pure consciousness—non-dual, unchanging, ever-free.

So here is the apparent problem:

- Karma belongs to the doer.
- The doer belongs to the waking identity.
- The waking identity is not ultimately real.
- Therefore, karma is not ultimately real.

If that logic is true, then karma cannot “stick” to Turiyam at all—because Turiyam is not an agent, not a body-mind, not a personality, not a bundle of intentions. It is like a perfectly non-stick surface: nothing adheres.

So does Advaita destroy karma?

In a certain sense, yes. But the word “destroy” needs precision.

Advaita does not deny karma the way a person denies gravity.  
It places karma at a particular **level of reality**—and that changes everything.

---

## 3) Three Levels of Reality: Where Karma Operates

Advaita uses a famous framework: **three tiers of reality**.

### (A) Paramarthika: the Absolute
This is the highest level—**Brahman/Turiyam**, pure consciousness, non-dual reality itself.

At this level:
- There is no separate world “out there.”
- There is no individual doer “in here.”
- There is no binding karma.
- There is no reward and punishment in the ordinary sense.

Not because ethics is meaningless, but because the entire structure of separate agency is transcended.

### (B) Vyavaharika: the Transactional World
This is the level of everyday life—the world of persons, duties, choices, consequences. It is the reality we inhabit when we wake up, pay bills, care for family, argue, forgive, learn, and grow.

At this level:
- Actions have consequences.
- Ethics and responsibility matter.
- Karma functions as a meaningful law.
- Suffering and happiness are experienced as real.

This level is not dismissed as “nothing.” It is treated as **empirically real**—real enough to govern lived life.

### (C) Pratibhasika: the Illusory
This is the level of dream, mirage, and error:
- A snake seen in a rope.
- Water seen in a desert.
- A full dream-world experienced at night.

At this level, consequences can still feel intense (a dream can terrify you), but the reality is weaker and collapses when knowledge dawns.

---

## 4) The Dream Analogy: Why Karma Can Be “Real” Yet Not Ultimate

To understand how karma can operate without contradicting “everything is Brahman,” Advaita often uses the dream analogy.

In a dream:
- You have a body.
- You encounter a world.
- You act.
- Consequences happen.
- Pain feels real.
- Joy feels real.

If you kick a rock in the dream, the dream rock can hurt the dream foot. The experience is consistent *within the dream’s level of reality.*

But when you wake up, you recognize:
- The entire dream was dependent on the waking mind.
- The dream did not touch the waking person as reality.
- The dream consequences were real only within the dream.

Advaita makes a bold claim:

The waking world is not the final level.  
It is real *transactionally*, but it is grounded in a higher reality—Turiyam.

So karma is like “dream physics,” except happening in waking life:
- It works reliably *within its domain*.
- It does not apply at the absolute level.

This does not trivialize ethical life. It locates it.

## 5) “Then Can an Enlightened Person Ignore Karma?”

Here we must be extremely careful. A common misunderstanding is:

> “If karma is not ultimately real, then morality doesn’t matter.”

That conclusion does not follow from Advaita; it follows from confusion.

Here is the subtle point:

**Karma does not bind Turiyam.  
But karma still operates in the transactional world.**

An enlightened person still has a body-mind functioning in the world. Fire still burns the body. Biology still affects health. Psychological causes still have psychological effects. Social actions still have social consequences.

So what changes?

**Identification changes.**

Instead of:
- “I am the body-mind, therefore karma binds me,”

it becomes:
- “The body-mind is functioning in the world of cause and effect, but I am the witnessing consciousness, untouched.”

This is not an escape from responsibility. If anything, genuine realization tends to deepen compassion and integrity—because selfish grasping and fear-driven behavior weaken.

A classic way to phrase this is:

At the level of the body-mind, laws still apply.  
At the level of Turiyam, you are free.

Both can be true simultaneously because they belong to different orders of reality.

## 6) The “Non-Stick” Reality: Why Nothing Clings to Turiyam

The transcript uses a vivid metaphor: Turiyam is “super Teflon”—nothing sticks.

Why?

Because karma is a property of **agency**, and agency requires:
- intention,
- effort,
- choice,
- ownership,
- identification.

Turiyam has none of these as inherent qualities. It is awareness itself—the light by which agency is known, not the agent.

Karma sticks to the sense of “I am the doer.”  
When that sense dissolves through knowledge, karma’s binding power collapses.

This is why Advaita sometimes sounds like it “smashes karma.” Ultimately, it does. But only ultimately.

Relatively, karma continues to appear—like scenes continuing in a movie even after you recognize the screen.

---

## 7) “Does This Mean Physics Also Doesn’t Apply?”

A follow-up question often comes: if karma doesn’t apply to Turiyam, do physical laws also fail?

The answer is parallel:

- The laws of physics apply to the body in the transactional world.
- They do not apply to Turiyam, because Turiyam is not a physical object.

If someone tries to “prove” Advaita by forcing the body to defy physics—like putting a hand into fire—Advaita doesn’t applaud that as wisdom. It calls it confusion.

The fire and the body belong to the same level of experience; they will interact according to the rules of that level. Realization does not turn the body into a supernatural exception. Realization changes who you take yourself to be.

So the correct stance is not:
- “Nothing can burn me,”

but rather:
- “The body can be burned, but I am not the body.”

That is the freedom Advaita points to: not magical immunity, but existential clarity.

## 8) A Deeper Insight: The Higher Reality Doesn’t Clash with the Lower

Advaita offers an elegant principle:

**A lower level of reality cannot affect a higher level of reality.**

- A mirage cannot wet real sand.
- A rope is not threatened by an imagined snake.
- A dream tragedy cannot damage the waking person.

Yet there is a second principle:

**The higher reality supports the lower.**

- Without the sand, no mirage appears.
- Without the rope, no snake illusion arises.
- Without the waking mind, no dream world exists.

Similarly:
- Without Turiyam, the waking world cannot appear.
- Without Turiyam, karma cannot even be experienced.
- Turiyam is the “ground” of all appearances, but is not modified by them.

This resolves the seeming contradiction:

Karma can function in the realm of appearances,  
while the absolute remains untouched.

## 9) So Where Does This Leave Ethics?

If Advaita is misunderstood, it can be used to bypass ethics.  
If Advaita is understood, it can purify ethics.

Here’s why:

When you believe you are only the individual doer, ethics easily becomes:
- reputation management,
- fear of punishment,
- hope of reward,
- tribal loyalty,
- self-image protection.

When you begin to see yourself as awareness itself, ethics can become:
- natural compassion,
- clarity of mind,
- absence of guilt-driven harm,
- freedom from craving,
- spontaneous respect for others.

In the transactional world, morality remains meaningful. It remains necessary. It remains part of spiritual maturity. The difference is that ethics is no longer chained to anxiety about “what happens to me.” It becomes aligned with truth.

You could say:

- **Karma is the law of the transactional world.**
- **Wisdom is knowing you are not ultimately limited to that world.**
- **Compassion is living in the transactional world without selfish bondage.**

## 10) Living the Two Truths at Once

Advaita doesn’t ask you to deny lived reality. It asks you to see it properly.

So the mature way to hold the teaching is something like this:

1. **As long as I function as a person, karma operates.**  
   My choices matter. My actions leave traces. Consequences come.

2. **At the deepest level, I am Turiyam—ever free.**  
   The real “I” is not improved by merit nor stained by sin.

3. **Realization does not cancel responsibility; it transforms it.**  
   It removes egoic ownership, not ethical sensitivity.

4. **Freedom is not exemption from the world; it is freedom in the world.**  
   Life continues. But it is carried lightly—without the crushing sense of bondage.

When this is understood, the spiritual goal becomes practical and luminous:

You live ethically not because you fear karma like a cosmic police system,  
but because clarity naturally expresses itself as harmony and care.

And you seek Turiyam not as an escape from life,  
but as the ground that makes life workable, even beautiful.

## Conclusion: Karma Matters—But It Doesn’t Define You

So, is karma incompatible with “everything is Brahman”?

No—if you understand levels of reality.

- **In the absolute sense**, karma does not bind Turiyam.
- **In the transactional sense**, karma is a valid and meaningful principle guiding moral life.
- **In spiritual practice**, the point is not to abolish ethics but to uproot the false identification that makes ethics heavy, fearful, and self-centered.

Karma belongs to the story of the person.  
Turiyam is the light in which the story appears.

The story continues, with its laws and consequences—  
but you discover you are not merely a character trapped inside it.

You are the awareness in which the whole play rises and falls.

And from that recognition, life can be lived with seriousness where seriousness is needed—  
and with a deep inner freedom that nothing can stain.
