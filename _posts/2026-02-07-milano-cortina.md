snippet: "Olympic pageantry mirrors ego and belonging; Vedanta points beyond roles to the witness within."
---
The opening ceremony is a world-sized mirror. Lights, flags, anthems, stories, athletes in formation—everything is designed to make identity feel real, warm, and shared. We cheer because we recognize ourselves in a tribe, a city, a nation, a dream. Milano Cortina 2026 will intensify that spell: winter’s glitter, speed, risk, elegance, and endurance. The heart swells, the eyes shine, and for a moment we feel located—named, chosen, included.

Vedanta does not reject this beauty. It simply asks: *Who is the “I” that thrills?* When music rises and you feel “I belong,” what exactly belongs—body, biography, status, memory? And when your team wins or loses, who is lifted or wounded? Ceremony-hype can become a spiritual laboratory. In the cresting emotion, the ego reveals its mechanics, and behind those mechanics shines something steady: the witness-mind, *sākṣī*—the awareness that sees belonging without being bound.

## 1) The Ceremony as a Factory of “Me”

A great opening ceremony is not only entertainment; it is a carefully crafted “I-maker.” It takes countless individuals and pours them into symbols: flags, uniforms, chants, colors, slogans, shared timelines. In one evening, your private self is invited into a bigger self: *“We.”* You borrow altitude from the group. You borrow meaning from the narrative. You borrow confidence from the crowd.

Vedanta would say: watch closely. This is *ahaṅkāra*—the “I-notion”—doing its ancient work: stitching together experiences into a story called “me.” The ego is not merely arrogance; it is the organizing principle that claims ownership.

- “**My** country.”  
- “**My** team.”  
- “**My** hero.”  
- “**My** moment.”  
- “**My** pride.”  

The claim itself is subtle and quick. It happens in the gap between sensation and interpretation. A drumbeat lands; a feeling arises; a thought labels it; the ego signs its name.

Vedanta doesn’t condemn the ego as a villain; it treats it as a tool mistaken for a king. The ego is useful in the marketplace—signing contracts, learning skills, keeping commitments. But in the inner life, when the tool becomes the ruler, it demands constant worship: approval, victory, belonging, specialness. And ceremonies—especially global ceremonies—are a feast for that ruler.

So the first teaching hidden inside the ceremony-hype is simple:

**Identity is manufactured in real time.**  
If you can see the manufacturing, you are already freer than the product.

## 2) Belonging: Sweetness with a Hidden Price

Belonging is one of the most tender human hungers. The opening ceremony offers belonging on an epic scale: you’re not alone; you’re part of a story larger than your daily worries. The feeling can be healing. Yet Vedanta asks: what is the hidden price?

Belonging, when clung to as identity, quietly demands an opposite: *exclusion.* To belong “here” must imply not belonging “there.” The mind divides. The heart narrows. And soon the ego measures itself by comparison: *my side vs. your side, our honor vs. your failure.*

This is why the same pageantry that can unite can also polarize. Not because celebration is wrong, but because the ego uses celebration as proof of its separateness.

Vedanta calls this *dvaita-buddhi*—the notion of duality: “I am a separate entity competing in a separate world.” Under this notion, emotion becomes a scoreboard:

- joy if “we” are praised  
- shame if “we” are mocked  
- anger if “we” are threatened  
- fear if “we” are ignored  

A ceremony becomes a spiritual test: can you let the heart open without letting the ego harden?

Here a quiet Upanishadic whisper helps:

**“Neti, neti”** — “Not this, not this.”  
Not this tribe alone. Not this status alone. Not this badge alone. Not this narrative alone.

This is not a rejection of culture. It is a refusal to be imprisoned by it.

## 3) Emotion: The Wave That Proves the Ocean

In the stadium, emotion surges: awe, nostalgia, tenderness, pride. Vedanta loves to examine emotion, because emotion is honest. It exposes what the mind values.

But Vedanta adds a crucial insight: **emotion is a wave, not the ocean.**  
If you ride the wave without knowing the ocean, you will drown in highs and lows. If you know the ocean, you can enjoy every wave without losing your depth.

What is the “ocean” here? It is awareness—*cit*—that lights up the entire experience. The cheering, the tears, the goosebumps, even the boredom in between—each is known. And whatever is known is not the knower.

This is the doorway to the witness.

The *Bhagavad Gītā* calls the steady one *sthita-prajña*—stable in wisdom—who is not tossed by pleasure and pain. A short phrase often remembered is: **“sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ”** — equal in sorrow and joy. Not numb; *balanced.*

Imagine watching the ceremony as two simultaneous events:

1) The surface event: lights, music, symbols, feelings.  
2) The deeper event: awareness noticing all of it.

The second event is always happening, but usually unnoticed. Ceremony-hype can intensify the first so dramatically that the second becomes finally obvious—like noticing the screen because the movie is so vivid.

---

## 4) The “Witness Mind” (*Sākṣī*) and the True Seat in the Stadium

Vedanta offers a radical suggestion: your truest seat in the stadium is not in the stands; it is in the witness.

The witness (*sākṣī*) is not a thought saying “I am aware.” It is the fact of awareness itself. Before you say “I,” awareness is. Before you feel proud, awareness is. Before you join the chant, awareness is. When the chant ends, awareness remains.

A classic Vedantic inquiry asks:

- The body is seen. Who sees it?  
- The breath is noticed. Who notices it?  
- The mind changes. Who knows change?  

Whatever changes cannot be the ultimate Self (*Ātman*). The witness does not change the way emotions change; it *witnesses* change.

This is why the Upanishads utter those lightning sentences—short enough to slip past argument and strike directly:

- **“Tat tvam asi”** — “That thou art.”  
- **“Aham brahmāsmi”** — “I am Brahman.”  
- **“Prajnānam brahma”** — “Consciousness is Brahman.”  

These are not motivational slogans. They are diagnoses: your essential nature is not the role, not the nation, not the fan, not the performer—**but the consciousness by which every role is known.**

If you can taste even a little of this during the ceremony, you will discover a paradox:

**You belong most deeply when you stop needing to belong.**  
Because the witness is already whole.

## 5) The Ego’s Costume Department: Roles, Masks, and the Olympic Self

The Olympics are a festival of roles:

- athlete  
- coach  
- commentator  
- fan  
- host  
- critic  
- sponsor  
- citizen  
- rival  

Each role comes with a script: how you should feel, what you should value, who you should admire, who you should dislike. The ego loves scripts because scripts simplify life. You don’t have to meet reality freshly; you can perform your identity.

Vedanta’s practical wisdom is not “stop roles,” but “don’t confuse role with Self.”

The *Vivekacūḍāmaṇi* and other Vedantic works repeatedly emphasize *viveka*—discrimination: the ability to separate the real from the fleeting. Roles are fleeting. Awareness is not.

Try this contemplation in the middle of any pageantry:

1) Let the mind fully experience the role-feeling (“I am proud,” “I am moved”).  
2) Then softly ask: **To whom does this arise?**  
3) Notice: the feeling arises *in* awareness.  
4) Rest as that awareness for a breath or two.

This is not anti-emotion. It is emotional freedom.

A role becomes poisonous only when the ego claims it as essence: “This is what I am.” Vedanta gently corrects: “This is what you are *doing* or *appearing as*.”

The same winter fire that makes a ceremony dazzling can burn the hand if you clutch it. Let it warm you; don’t possess it.

## 6) Milano and Cortina: Two Poles, One Lesson

Even the name “Milano Cortina” carries a symbolic teaching: two distinct centers joined into one event. In Vedantic language, this resembles the union of apparent opposites—city and mountain, fashion and ice, crowd and solitude, speed and silence.

The mind often believes freedom lies in choosing one pole and rejecting the other:

- “I want the city life, not the mountain.”  
- “I want excitement, not stillness.”  
- “I want belonging, not aloneness.”  

Vedanta says the deeper freedom is not in choosing poles, but in knowing the ground in which both poles appear.

That ground is awareness.  
The witness is the unifying principle.

So the ceremony’s “identity” theme—whatever form it takes—can be spiritually re-read:

**Identity is a bridge, not a prison.**  
Walk across it to discover the one who walks.

---

## 7) The Five Sheaths (*Pañca Kośa*) in One Night of Spectacle

Vedanta offers a beautifully precise map of layered identity: the five sheaths (*kośas*). The opening ceremony activates them all.

1) **Annamaya-kośa** — the “food sheath,” the body.  
   You feel the cold imagery, the physical sensations, the thrill in the skin.

2) **Prāṇamaya-kośa** — the energy/breath sheath.  
   Breath speeds up. Heart rate rises. The crowd’s rhythm entrains your nervous system.

3) **Manomaya-kośa** — the mind/emotion sheath.  
   You feel pride, nostalgia, devotion, longing, envy, wonder.

4) **Vijñānamaya-kośa** — the intellect/discernment sheath.  
   You interpret symbols, infer meaning, judge artistry, form opinions.

5) **Ānandamaya-kośa** — the bliss sheath.  
   You taste a quiet happiness, a sweetness of unity—sometimes subtle, sometimes intense.

The kośa teaching is not to deny these layers, but to recognize: **none of these layers is the final Self.** They are garments worn by awareness.

A ceremony can be used like a meditation: each sheath lights up; you notice it; you release identification; you rest as the witness.

The most sacred line in this practice is not complicated:

**“I am the knower of these experiences.”**  
And then even that sentence is dropped—because the witness is prior to words.

## 8) The Three States and the Stadium: Waking, Dream, Deep Sleep

The *Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad* is famously brief and shockingly deep. It points to the three common states—waking, dream, deep sleep—and then to the Fourth (*Turīya*): pure awareness.

The opening ceremony belongs to waking. But notice: the mind in waking can behave like dreaming—projecting meaning, building fantasies, amplifying symbols beyond their factual weight. In hype, we don’t just see dancers; we see destiny. We don’t just hear an anthem; we hear eternity.

Vedanta’s point is not to mock this, but to reveal a truth:

**The mind is a projector.**  
And awareness is the screen.

When you grasp this, you can enjoy the projection while remembering the screen. Then you are not hypnotized by waking-dreams.

And what about deep sleep? After the ceremony, when the lights go out and identity-stories dissolve, you enter a state where you don’t need a flag to be at peace. In deep sleep, you do not chant, you do not compare, you do not strive. Yet you exist.

Vedanta uses this as evidence: your being does not depend on your role. The witness persists as the silent basis.

So a ceremony can become a doorway to *Turīya*—not as a mystical event, but as recognition: the awareness that knows waking and dream and sleep is your real nature.

## 9) “I Want to Be Part of Something”: The Spiritual Core of Hype

Let’s be honest: beneath the fireworks is a prayer. People don’t merely want a show. They want meaning. They want to feel part of something that lifts them out of personal smallness.

Vedanta agrees with the aspiration but challenges the strategy.

The ego tries to escape smallness by attaching to bigness:

- a nation  
- a movement  
- a victory  
- a crowd  
- a hero  

But attachment is a fragile ladder. If the ladder shakes—if the team loses, if the narrative cracks, if the crowd turns—your sense of self falls.

Vedanta offers a sturdier foundation: **you are not small in essence.**  
The Self is not a fragment competing for significance; the Self is the luminous reality in which significance appears.

This is the shock of nonduality (*advaita*). The world’s drama is not denied, but its ultimacy is questioned.

A well-known Vedantic saying goes: **“Brahma satyam, jagan mithyā.”**  
Often understood as: Brahman is real; the world is relatively real, like a passing appearance.

Interpreted wisely, it doesn’t mean the world is worthless. It means the world is not the final source of your worth.

So the spiritual core of hype—*I want to belong to something meaningful*—is fulfilled in Vedanta by turning inward:

**You already belong to Being itself.**  
And Being belongs to no one.

---

## 10) The Fire of Competition and the Ice of Clarity

The Olympics celebrate competition. Vedanta does not fear competition; it fears ignorance. Competition becomes toxic only when ego mistakes outcomes for identity.

A clean competition says: “I will offer my best.”  
An egoic competition says: “If I win, I exist.”

The opening ceremony lights the fire of “We will triumph.” That fire can energize discipline and excellence. But if it burns without clarity, it scorches the heart with anxiety and aggression.

Vedanta prescribes a cooling wisdom: *karma-yoga*—the yoga of action with inner freedom. The *Gītā* provides the central principle:

**“To action alone you have a right.”**  
And: **“Not to the fruits.”**

In plain language: do your part with devotion, but don’t chain your peace to results.

Imagine applying this to the ceremony’s emotional contagion:

- Let inspiration arise, but don’t demand it persist.  
- Let pride arise, but don’t let it harden into superiority.  
- Let belonging arise, but don’t let it become exclusion.  

This is the icy clarity that makes the winter games not only athletic but symbolic:  
**fire refined by ice.**  
Passion refined by wisdom.

## 11) The Crowd-Mind and the Individual Soul

In a stadium, individual psychology melts into crowd psychology. You feel what others feel. You chant what others chant. You might even believe what others believe for a while.

Vedanta would call this the movement of *saṁskāras* (mental impressions) and *vāsanās* (tendencies) amplified by collective energy. The crowd can uplift—like congregational singing. The crowd can also intoxicate—like a mob.

So Vedanta suggests a gentle inner stance: participate, but keep a lamp lit inside.

A simple inner mantra can serve as a lamp:

**“I am the witness of this mind.”**

Then even as you feel swept, part of you remains still. This stillness is not cold; it is mature. It allows love without blindness.

The sages describe the liberated one as moving among experiences like a lotus leaf on water—touching without being soaked.

---

## 12) The Athlete as a Living Metaphor of Sādhana

An athlete’s life resembles spiritual practice (*sādhana*) in uncanny ways:

- discipline  
- repetition  
- sacrifice  
- endurance through boredom  
- humility under coaching  
- resilience after failure  
- concentration under pressure  
- devotion to a goal beyond immediate comfort  

The ceremony honors athletes, but Vedanta invites you to see the deeper athlete: the one training attention.

Your real “event” is not only on ice or snow; it is in consciousness.  
Your real “gold” is not a medal; it is freedom from bondage to moods.  
Your real “podium” is not in a stadium; it is in the heart’s stillness.

When you watch an athlete enter with a flag, you can ask:

**What flag am I carrying inside?**  
Is it pride? Is it insecurity? Is it longing? Is it resentment?  
And who is the awareness that sees this flag?

This transforms spectatorship into self-knowledge.

---

## 13) Identity’s Three Hooks: Name, Form, Story

Vedanta often analyzes worldly reality as *nāma-rūpa*—name and form—floating on the deeper reality. Add a third element in modern life: story.

1) **Name:** labels—nation, gender, profession, ideology, fandom.  
2) **Form:** appearance—body, uniform, symbol, flag, color.  
3) **Story:** narrative—history, victory, trauma, destiny.

The opening ceremony intensifies all three. That is why it feels so “real.”

But the witness is prior to all three. You can change your name, your form changes with time, your stories evolve—yet awareness remains the constant knower.

If you want a direct practice during hype, try this:

- Notice the *name* you’re wearing right now (“fan,” “citizen,” “critic”).  
- Notice the *form* sensations (breath, posture, energy).  
- Notice the *story* in the mind (“This is historic,” “We must win”).  
- Then rest as the one who notices.

This is *ātma-vicāra*—Self-inquiry—applied to modern spectacle.

---

## 14) The Witness Is Not Detached; It Is Intimate

A common misunderstanding: people think witnessing means becoming distant, above life, emotionally dry. Vedanta’s witness is not a frozen observer. It is the most intimate reality: the light by which every intimacy is known.

When you are the witness, you can feel more fully because you are not afraid of feeling. You are not bargaining with emotion: “Stay forever.” You let it rise and fall like music.

In fact, the witness is the ground of love. Ego-love often says: “I love you because you enhance my identity.” Witness-love says: “I see you as you are, because I am free.”

So when the ceremony tries to make you emotional, the spiritual move is not to resist, but to **feel with awareness**.

The sages would say: enjoy the dance of *māyā* without forgetting Brahman.

---

## 15) The Sacred Thread in National Anthems: From “Mine” to “One”

National anthems are powerful because they touch sacrifice and memory. They can awaken gratitude for culture, language, ancestors, art, and struggle. Vedanta does not demand you erase these; it asks you to expand beyond possessiveness.

The inner evolution is subtle:

- Stage 1: “My nation is my identity.”  
- Stage 2: “My nation is one expression of human life.”  
- Stage 3: “All nations arise in the same consciousness.”  

In Stage 3, you can honor your roots without hating others. You can cheer without contempt. You can belong without shrinking.

This is not political commentary; it is spiritual maturity.

A quiet Vedantic reframe:

**Let symbols point you inward, not outward.**  
Let an anthem remind you of the song of Being—the silent “I am” beneath all languages.

---

## 16) When Tears Come: The Upanishadic Permission to Be Human

Sometimes a ceremony makes you unexpectedly cry. You don’t know why. The throat tightens. The heart opens. A memory flashes. A longing rises.

Vedanta would say: this is grace—*anugraha*—not because tears are holy, but because they soften the ego’s armor. Tears reveal that beneath the identity-claims is a simple, vulnerable consciousness yearning for wholeness.

In that moment, don’t rush to explain yourself. Don’t convert tears into a story. Instead, notice:

- Tears are seen.  
- The ache is known.  
- The warmth is present.  

Who knows?

The witness does.

And the witness is not wounded by tears. Tears happen *in* awareness like rain in the sky. The sky does not become wet.

This is one of Vedanta’s most healing images:  
**You are the sky, not the weather.**

---

## 17) The Ceremony’s “Meaning” and Vedanta’s Meaning

Ceremonies try to deliver meaning through narratives: heritage, innovation, unity, resilience, beauty. Vedanta respects narrative meaning but distinguishes it from existential meaning.

Narrative meaning answers: *What does this symbolize?*  
Existential meaning answers: *What am I?*

Narrative meaning can inspire. Existential meaning liberates.

When people say, “That ceremony was meaningful,” often they mean, “It made me feel connected to something larger.” Vedanta agrees, but pushes further:

**The largest “something” is consciousness itself.**  
Not merely larger as in “big,” but larger as in “limitless.”

This is why Vedanta is sometimes called *pūrṇatā*—the teaching of fullness. The Self is complete, not because it owns everything, but because it lacks nothing.

So the opening ceremony becomes a spiritual riddle:

You seek fullness through spectacle.  
Vedanta offers fullness through self-knowledge.

Can you allow spectacle to become a pointer rather than a replacement?

---

## 18) A Nondual Reading of “Identity”

The theme of “identity” can be read in two ways:

1) **Identity as possession:** “I am this particular someone.”  
2) **Identity as essence:** “I am awareness itself.”

The first identity is practical, necessary, and limited. The second is liberating, fundamental, and limitless.

Vedanta doesn’t say the first is false in a crude way; it says it is *relative.* It belongs to the realm of *vyavahāra*—transactions. In transactions, you have a name and a passport and a history. But your deepest nature is *paramārtha*—ultimate—beyond transactions.

If you forget this, identity becomes a cage.  
If you remember it, identity becomes a costume you can wear gracefully.

A simple sentence captures the whole practice:

**“I am not merely a person; I am the presence in which personhood appears.”**

---

## 19) The Ashtavakra Flavor: Freedom in the Middle of the Show

Some Vedantic texts speak with fierce simplicity. The *Aṣṭāvakra Gītā* is famous for that uncompromising tone: you are free now, not later; bondage is misidentification; liberation is recognition.

Applied to ceremony-hype, that teaching would sound like:

You are not a fan.  
You are not a citizen.  
You are not a body shivering at a winter spectacle.  
You are awareness—unchanging, complete.

This doesn’t make you stop being a fan. It makes fandom harmless.

Freedom is not “after the event.”  
Freedom is the witness of the event.

---

## 20) A Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Lens: Many Paths, One Consciousness

Vedanta, especially in the modern tradition inspired by Sri Ramakrishna and taught powerfully by Swami Vivekananda, often emphasizes harmony: many temperaments, one Truth.

Some hearts need devotion (*bhakti*).  
Some need inquiry (*jñāna*).  
Some need service (*karma*).  
Some need meditation (*rāja-yoga*).

The opening ceremony can touch all temperaments:

- Devotional hearts feel reverence for excellence and sacrifice.  
- Inquiry minds ask what meaning is and who feels it.  
- Service hearts feel solidarity with humanity’s shared striving.  
- Meditative minds notice breath, attention, and stillness amid noise.

So rather than treating the ceremony as “worldly distraction,” you can treat it as a multi-path classroom.

One can silently pray:  
“May this celebration awaken unity, not arrogance.”  
One can inquire:  
“Who is aware of this pride?”  
One can serve:  
“May my joy become kindness.”  
One can meditate:  
“Breath in, breath out—awareness remains.”

This is Vedanta not as escape, but as integration.

---

## 21) Practical Sādhana: How to Use Ceremony-Hype as Meditation

Here is a simple step-by-step practice you can do while watching any emotionally intense spectacle:

### Step A: Name the experience without ownership
Instead of “I am proud,” try:  
**“Pride is arising.”**  
Instead of “I am moved,” try:  
**“Emotion is arising.”**

This small linguistic shift loosens ego’s grip.

### Step B: Locate it in the body
Where is the feeling? Chest? Throat? Belly?  
Feel the raw sensation without commentary.

### Step C: Notice the thought-story
What story is fueling it?  
“We are special.” “This is historic.” “I finally belong.”

### Step D: Turn to the witness
Ask gently: **“What knows this?”**  
Then pause. Don’t answer with words. Rest in the knowing itself.

### Step E: Return to enjoyment
Go back to the ceremony with a lighter heart.  
Enjoy fully—but from the witness, not from craving.

This is a modern doorway into an ancient truth: the witness can include everything without being captured by anything.

## 22) The Most Subtle Trap: Spiritual Ego in a Stadium

Even spiritual practice can become ego’s new costume. The mind may whisper: “I’m above this spectacle. I’m not like these emotional people.” That is still identity—just dressed in spiritual superiority.

Vedanta’s witness is humble. It does not need to be “better.” It is simply clear.

If you notice spiritual pride arising, treat it like any other wave:

**“Pride is arising.”**  
Known by what?  
The witness.

Then the trap dissolves, and you are free again—free to be human, free to enjoy, free to learn.

---

## 23) What Remains After the Lights Fade

After the ceremony ends, something quiet happens. Screens dim. People sleep. The nervous system settles. The mind’s grand narrative dissolves into ordinary life: breakfast, work, errands, silence.

Vedanta asks: what remains when the story ends?

Awareness remains.  
The witness remains.  
The simple sense “I am” remains.

This is the spiritual gold hidden in every spectacle: it ends. And because it ends, it can’t be your foundation. The ending is not a loss; it is a teaching.

If you can carry one insight from Milano Cortina 2026 into daily life, let it be this:

**Belonging is beautiful—but the witness is home.**

Home is not a place on a map. Home is the awareness that never leaves you.

---

## 24) Closing: Identity, Emotion, Meaning—Reclaimed

The opening ceremony will offer identity: a grand “we.”  
Vedanta offers identity: the silent “I” prior to all “we.”

The ceremony will offer emotion: a wave of shared feeling.  
Vedanta offers emotion: fully felt, fully known, not clung to.

The ceremony will offer meaning: a story told in light and sound.  
Vedanta offers meaning: the Self, complete, shining as the witness of every story.

So watch the pageantry with open eyes and an open heart. Let the beauty move you. Let the human striving inspire you. Then, in the very peak of hype, remember the deepest seat in the stadium:

Not in the stands.  
Not on the ice.  
Not on the flag.  

But in the witness—*sākṣī*—the awareness that knows all identities and yet remains free.

**Tat tvam asi.**  
That—this awareness—*you are.*
