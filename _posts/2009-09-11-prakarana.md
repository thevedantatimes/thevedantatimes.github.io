---
Drig-Drishya Viveka is a short prakaraṇa text in the Advaita Vedanta tradition that trains the mind to discriminate between the seer and the seen. It begins from ordinary experience, where we notice objects, sensations, thoughts, and emotions, and asks a simple question: what is it that knows them. By patiently tracing knowing back to its source, the text points to awareness itself as our constant identity, independent of changing appearances. This inquiry is practical; it reorganizes attention and dissolves confusion.

The work is often presented as eight stages of analysis, like lamps illuminating a room. Each stage shifts the locus of identity from gross objects to subtler layers: body, senses, mind, and finally the witnessing consciousness. Along the way it uses familiar tools of Vedanta: viveka, vairagya, and reasoning supported by scripture. The goal is not to deny the world, but to see the world as appearance in awareness, and to rest in the freedom of the witness right now.

## Term and domain

**Term:** Drig-Drishya Viveka  
**Category subject:** Prakaraṇa  
**Category text:** Drig-Drishya Viveka  

A prakaraṇa is a focused treatise that presents one practical line of teaching with clarity and economy. Instead of covering the whole philosophical landscape, it selects a single method and applies it repeatedly until the student sees the point directly. Drig-Drishya Viveka does exactly this by taking the everyday contrast between subject and object and sharpening it into a tool for liberation.

## The central question: who is the seer

In ordinary life, we speak as if the body is the self. Yet the body is something we can notice. You can feel a heartbeat, detect fatigue, observe posture, and even look at your hands as objects. Whatever is observed is part of the seen. The seer is that which observes, the knower that cannot be reduced to what is known. This is the basic move: begin with a simple fact of experience and refuse to stop at the first, most habitual identification.

The text expands this move through layers. The eyes see forms, but the eyes themselves are objects of knowledge when you notice strain, dryness, or clarity. The mind knows thoughts, but the mind itself is known when you notice restlessness, focus, or a mood. Memory appears and disappears; attention rises and falls. Each of these is seen. The seer is the stable light in which all these variations are registered.

## Discrimination as a disciplined habit

Viveka, discrimination, is not cold analysis. It is a disciplined habit of placing identity where it belongs. Without discrimination, attention fuses with whatever is prominent: a sensation, a worry, a social role, a narrative about the past. With discrimination, experience is still fully felt, yet the feeling is placed in the category of the seen, while awareness remains in the category of the seer.

This shift has two effects. First, it reduces unnecessary suffering. Much distress comes from taking a passing mental event to be "me." Second, it creates a stable platform for inquiry. When the mind is less reactive, it can investigate subtler truths without being hijacked by fear or craving.

## What is meant by "drig" and "drishya"

"Drig" means the seer, the principle of knowing. "Drishya" means the seen, anything that can be presented to knowledge. The text invites you to test the distinction rather than accept it as doctrine. If something can be pointed to, described, compared, or remembered, it is drishya. If something is the condition for pointing, describing, comparing, and remembering, it functions as drig.

A helpful everyday example is a movie screen. Many scenes appear: deserts, cities, oceans, faces, storms. The scenes change, but the screen does not turn into a storm or a face. It allows appearances without becoming any appearance. The witness is like the screen. The mind is like the sequence of scenes. The body is like the theater seat and surroundings. The point is not to hate the scenes, but to recognize what never changes through them.

## The witness and its unique status

Vedanta often uses the term sākṣī, the witness, to describe consciousness as the knower of mental events. Drig-Drishya Viveka refines this by showing that the witness is not another object inside the mind. It is not a special thought called "witnessing." Any thought that claims "I am the witness" is still a thought, therefore seen. The witness is what knows that thought.

This can feel slippery at first, because the mind wants to grasp the witness as an experience. But the witness is the constant factor in all experiences. You cannot step outside it to look at it, just as you cannot use your eyes to see "seeing" as an object. You can only notice that seeing is already present as the condition of any visual object. Likewise, awareness is already present as the condition of any thought, sensation, or perception.

## The gradual shift from gross to subtle

The text commonly proceeds by a graded analysis, sometimes described as eight "lamps" or steps. Different teachers group these steps slightly differently, but the underlying movement is consistent: from the gross world to the subtle instruments of experience, and finally to pure witnessing.

### Lamp 1: objects are seen

External objects are clearly drishya. A cup, a tree, a sound, a fragrance, a taste, a texture are all presented to awareness. They come and go. They are known, and therefore not the knower.

### Lamp 2: the body is seen

The body is also an object. It is perceived through the senses and inferred through sensations. Even the sense of "my body" is a concept that appears in awareness. The body changes from childhood to adulthood to old age, while the fact of knowing the body remains.

### Lamp 3: the senses are seen

The senses are instruments. You can notice when vision is sharp or blurry, when hearing is dull or acute. This noticing shows that the senses are objects of knowledge. They are not the final subject.

### Lamp 4: the mind is seen

The mind is the inner instrument that presents thoughts, images, emotions, and intentions. The mind is observed in meditation and in ordinary reflection. Because it is observed, it belongs to the seen. The seer is that in which the mind's movements are known.

### Lamp 5: intellect and ego are seen

Subtler still are the functions of judging, deciding, and claiming ownership, often summarized as intellect and ego. You can notice a decision forming, a doubt arising, or pride swelling. These are known states. The witness is prior to them.

### Lamp 6: the reflected consciousness

Vedanta explains that the mind appears sentient because consciousness is reflected in it, like sunlight reflected in water. This reflected consciousness gives the sense of a personal "I" that knows and acts. Drig-Drishya Viveka uses this idea to separate the true light from its reflection. The reflection can waver with the mind. The original light does not waver.

### Lamp 7: the witness as ever present

When the reflection is understood as dependent, attention can rest more easily in witnessing itself. The witness is self-revealing. It does not need another light to be known, because every other light, including the light of thought, depends on it.

### Lamp 8: nondual resolution

Finally, the text points toward the nondual conclusion: the witness is not a private entity inside a body. It is Brahman, the limitless reality that is the ground of all appearances. The world is not outside Brahman; it is a presentation within Brahman. Liberation is not a new experience added to the witness. It is the recognition that the witness was never bound.

## How reasoning works in this text

The reasoning is simple but relentless. It rests on two observations:

1. The seen is always changing.  
2. The seer is the constant knower of change.

From these, it follows that the seer cannot be identical to any particular changing object, including the body and mind. The method is similar to peeling an onion, but with an important difference: when you remove each layer, you do not end up with nothing. You end up with the ever present fact of awareness, which was present at every stage.

This also explains why the text is practical. Every time you suffer from identification, you can apply the test: is this state known. If it is known, it is seen. Therefore it is not the self. The self is the knower. This does not make the state disappear, but it changes your relationship to it. The state becomes an appearance, not an identity.

## Three common confusions, cleared gently

### Confusion 1: witnessing means becoming detached and cold

Witnessing is not emotional numbness. It is intimacy without entanglement. You can feel grief fully while recognizing it as a passing wave in awareness. In fact, discrimination often makes compassion steadier, because reactions are less self-centered.

### Confusion 2: the witness is a blank void

Some people mistake the witness for a dull emptiness. But awareness is not an absence. It is the luminous presence that knows both fullness and emptiness, both thought and silence. The mind may become quiet in meditation, and that quiet can be refreshing, but the witness is what knows quiet.

### Confusion 3: "I am the witness" is just a thought

It is true that the sentence "I am the witness" is a thought. Yet it can function like a pointer. The thought is useful if it turns attention toward what is already present as the knower of the thought. After the pointing, the mind can let the sentence go, and the recognition can remain.

## A simple practice sequence inspired by the text

1. **Start with the obvious.** Notice a sound, then recognize, "sound is seen."  
2. **Include the body.** Notice a sensation, then recognize, "sensation is seen."  
3. **Include the mind.** Notice a thought, then recognize, "thought is seen."  
4. **Rest as the knower.** Without searching for a special state, recognize the simple fact, "knowing is present."  
5. **Repeat in life.** During stress, label the experience as seen and return to the seer.

This practice is not about forcing constant self-remembrance. It is about building a new default. Over time, the mind learns that awareness is the home position, and objects, including thoughts, are visitors.

## The ethical and psychological edge

Although Drig-Drishya Viveka is metaphysical, it has ethical consequences. When identity is less tied to egoic stories, behavior becomes less defensive. You can admit mistakes without collapse, appreciate others without jealousy, and act firmly without hatred. Detachment here means freedom from compulsive grasping, not indifference.

Psychologically, the method can be stabilizing. Many anxieties are fueled by overidentification with prediction thoughts. When a prediction is recognized as a seen object, it loses absolute authority. You still plan and act responsibly, but you do so without granting every thought the status of a final truth.

## Nonduality without bypassing

A mature reading avoids bypassing. Seeing appearances in awareness does not erase responsibility. Care for the body, honesty in relationships, and action still matter. The shift is acting from clarity, not a self-story.

Nonduality also does not mean that personal experience must vanish. The mind can still think, the heart can still love, and the senses can still enjoy. What changes is the background conviction that these experiences define the self. They become expressions within awareness, not chains around awareness.

## A short contemplation to close

Right now, notice any experience present: a sensation in the body, a thought about reading, a sound in the room. Each is drishya, seen. Then notice the simple fact that you are aware of it. That awareness is drig, the seer. The seer is not far away, because it is what makes distance and nearness known. Remain as that simple knowing for a few breaths, and let the mind learn its source.
