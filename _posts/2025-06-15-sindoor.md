snippet: "May 2025 strikes and ceasefire invite Vedantic dharma, ahimsa, discernment, and healing for Kashmir."
---
In May 2025, grief in Kashmir hardened into a brief but frightening spiral: India struck targets in Pakistan after a deadly attack, each side answered, and the world watched two nuclear neighbors edge toward a wider war. Then came a ceasefire, announced after intense diplomacy, and a fragile return from the brink. Vedanta does not treat such events as mere headlines. It asks what in the human mind turns sorrow into escalation, and what turns courage into restraint for peace.

This essay offers a Vedantic lens for the days of escalation and the ceasefire that followed. It will honor the suffering of civilians while refusing to romanticize violence. Drawing from the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the yamas of yoga, we explore dharma in statecraft, ahimsa as a discipline of restraint, and viveka as the difference between facts and narratives. The aim is not to judge nations, but to cultivate wisdom that steadies hearts and policies alike in a crisis.

## 1. What happened in May 2025: a brief outline

A careful Vedantic reading begins with satya, truthfulness. In public crises, truth is often the first casualty, not because people love lies, but because fear and anger amplify partial facts. So we start with a modest outline, using only widely reported elements and acknowledging disputed claims.

In late April 2025, a deadly attack in the Kashmir region killed dozens of civilians, including tourists, and triggered intense outrage and grief . India blamed militant networks linked to Pakistan, while Pakistan denied involvement . In early May, India carried out strikes into Pakistani territory and Pakistani administered Kashmir, describing the targets as “terrorist infrastructure” connected to the earlier attack . Pakistan condemned the strikes and reported casualties, while India maintained it targeted militant facilities .

Over several days, both sides reported exchanges of fire and strikes, and concerns rose internationally because both countries are nuclear armed . On 10 May 2025, India and Pakistan announced a ceasefire, with officials indicating that all firing and military action on land, in the air, and at sea would stop from a specified time that evening . The United States publicly described intensive diplomacy with senior officials on both sides and welcomed the agreement . The United Nations Secretary General also welcomed the ceasefire as a positive step toward ending hostilities and easing tensions . Reports later the same day described alleged violations and continued uncertainty, a reminder that ceasefires are not a finish line but a fragile doorway .

This outline is enough for our purpose. Vedanta is not interested in tactical triumphs. It is interested in the inner mechanics that drive escalation and the inner strengths that make de escalation possible.

## 2. Vedanta and the anatomy of escalation

Vedanta begins where every conflict begins: in the human mind. Missiles and speeches come later. First come perception, interpretation, and identification. The Upanishads repeatedly teach that when the mind identifies with a limited self, it oscillates between craving and fear. In collective life, that limited self becomes a group identity. “My people” becomes “my self,” and then injury to the group is felt as injury to the ego.

The Bhagavad Gita does not deny the reality of harm. It recognizes grief and anger as powerful forces. Yet it asks a deeper question: can action emerge from clarity rather than rage? Krishna’s first counsel to Arjuna is not a policy memo. It is a diagnostic. When the mind is overwhelmed, it cannot see dharma. It sees only an enemy and a demand for immediate relief.

A Vedantic model of escalation can be described in five steps:

1. Shock: an attack or loss creates raw grief.
2. Story: grief becomes a narrative of betrayal and threat.
3. Identity: the story hardens into “we” versus “they.”
4. Compulsion: action becomes urgent, not necessarily wise.
5. Echo: each action creates new grief, feeding the cycle.

Vedanta does not moralize this sequence. It illuminates it, so it can be interrupted. The Yoga Sutras offers a practical tool: “maitri karuna mudita upeksanam,” cultivating friendliness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity toward different kinds of people. This is not naive softness. It is a mental training that prevents the mind from being hijacked by hatred.

In the 2025 crisis, the stressors that intensify escalation were familiar to modern life:

- Nuclear shadow: fear of catastrophic escalation magnifies anxiety.
- Information fog: misinformation and partial reporting spread quickly .
- Political incentives: leaders face pressure to appear strong.
- Media tempo: outrage cycles move faster than verification.
- Trauma memory: Kashmir carries decades of pain, which resurfaces easily.

Vedanta’s contribution is to say: these stressors are not merely external. They enter through the mind’s gunas.

## 3. The three gunas of statecraft: sattva, rajas, tamas

The gunas are not abstract philosophy. They are patterns that describe how energy moves through mind and institution.

### 3.1 Sattva: clarity that protects life

Sattva is luminous steadiness. In a crisis, sattva shows up as:

- accurate public communication that avoids humiliation language
- restraint in targeting and a priority on civilian protection
- willingness to accept mediation without feeling diminished
- humility to correct misinformation publicly
- rapid humanitarian support for victims and displaced families

Sattva does not mean inaction. It means action aligned with dharma and grounded in truth.

The Isha Upanishad begins with a vision that can elevate policy: “All this is pervaded by the Lord.” When leaders and citizens remember a shared sacredness in life, the appetite to punish for emotional satisfaction weakens. Protective action can still occur, but it generally becomes more discriminating.

### 3.2 Rajas: speed, pride, and the heat of competition

Rajas is energy and ambition. In a crisis, rajas can protect by enabling quick mobilization and decisive diplomacy. Yet rajas easily turns into performative escalation. It demands visible strength, fast retaliation, and clear winners.

When rajas dominates, leaders may feel trapped between public anger and international pressure. They may speak in absolutes, making compromise look like weakness. They may underestimate how quickly tit for tat can grow.

Vedanta does not condemn rajas. It asks that rajas be yoked to viveka, discernment.

### 3.3 Tamas: denial, fog, and fatalism

Tamas is inertia and obscuration. In conflict, tamas shows up as:

- denial of civilian suffering on the other side
- refusal to verify claims because verification is inconvenient
- fatalism: “this will never change”
- the moral fog that treats all violence as normal

Tamas is dangerous because it numbs conscience. It makes cruelty feel ordinary. It also makes peace feel impossible, which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

Vedanta’s remedy for tamas is awakening. The Katha Upanishad calls for rising and learning from the wise: “Arise, awake.” In policy terms, awakening means refusing to normalize harm and refusing to accept endless cycles as destiny.

## 4. Dharma in a world of borders and wounds

The word dharma is often invoked in conflict, sometimes to justify retaliation. Vedanta insists on a stricter meaning. Dharma is that which upholds life and order with minimal harm. It is not the mere satisfaction of anger.

In the Gita, Krishna speaks to a warrior in crisis. Yet the core teaching is not “fight.” It is “act from wisdom.” Arjuna’s grief is not mocked. It is purified. Krishna urges him to see beyond personal rage and ask what action truly serves the whole.

When states respond to terror, they face a real dharmic tension:

- the duty to protect citizens and deter future attacks
- the duty to avoid harming innocents and escalating war

A Vedantic approach does not pretend this tension is easy. It offers a discipline: hold both duties at once, and refuse to solve the tension by erasing the humanity of the other.

A famous line from the Taittiriya Upanishad serves as a civic compass: “Satyam vada, dharmam chara,” speak truth, practice dharma. Truth and dharma together. If either is missing, the response becomes unstable.

In May 2025, international statements condemned terrorism and called for restraint, reflecting a broad recognition of this tension . The existence of a ceasefire agreement itself reflects the possibility that protection and restraint can coexist, even after frightening escalation .

## 5. Ahimsa is not passivity: the discipline of minimizing harm

Ahimsa is sometimes caricatured as refusal to act. Vedanta and the wider dharmic tradition treat it as an advanced discipline: act in ways that reduce harm and do not create unnecessary enemies.

Ahimsa in public life includes several layers:

1. Intent: do not seek revenge as emotional pleasure.
2. Method: avoid indiscriminate force and prioritize civilian safety.
3. Speech: avoid dehumanizing language that licenses cruelty.
4. Aftercare: support victims and prevent collective punishment.
5. Remediation: repair harm where possible, including across borders.

Ahimsa also recognizes that violence, once unleashed, creates new karmic chains. Karma here is not superstition. It is cause and effect. Each strike produces grief. Each grief produces anger. Each anger demands a new act. The wheel turns.

Vedanta therefore treats the ceasefire not as a political embarrassment but as a moral achievement: an interruption of karma. The Upanishadic peace invocation ends with “shanti” repeated, often interpreted as peace in the inner world, the outer world, and the unseen forces. A ceasefire is outer peace. Without inner peace, outer peace collapses. That is why Vedanta insists that governance is also psychology.

## 6. Viveka in the fog of narratives and misinformation

During major crises, citizens are inundated with claims: casualty numbers, alleged targets, dramatic videos, and triumphant declarations. Analysts warned that the May 2025 crisis was accompanied by considerable misinformation and disinformation, complicating public understanding . Vedanta’s tool here is viveka, discrimination between the real and the imagined, between what is known and what is inferred.

The Mundaka Upanishad distinguishes between lower knowledge and higher knowledge, not to insult facts, but to warn against mistaking information for wisdom. Lower knowledge is the realm of data and reports. Higher knowledge is the clarity that prevents data from becoming fuel for hatred.

Practically, viveka in a crisis means:

- Separate verified facts from claims.
- Resist humiliation narratives: “they are animals,” “they deserve it.”
- Notice emotional addiction to outrage.
- Ask: what action would reduce suffering tomorrow, not only satisfy anger today.
- Hold uncertainty honestly.

Viveka also prevents spiritual bypassing. Vedanta does not say “all is one, so nothing matters.” It says “all is one, so everything matters.” If the other is not other, then civilian suffering across the border is not a statistic. It is our shared wound.

## 7. Karma yoga for leaders: action without ego possession

Karma yoga is a framework for acting responsibly under pressure. The Gita frames it memorably: “You have a right to action, not to the fruits of action.” It has two pillars:

- Ishvara arpanam: offer action to the highest good.
- Prasada buddhi: receive results without ego collapse or arrogance.

For leaders, karma yoga is radical because it breaks the addiction to image. A leader who is not enslaved by “how it looks” can choose de escalation when de escalation is wise. They can accept mediation without treating it as humiliation. They can speak to their own public with honesty: “We will protect life, but we will not burn the future.”

Karma yoga also supports accountability. If action is offered to dharma, then mistakes must be admitted. The mind that can admit error is generally more stable than the mind that must always appear infallible.

In May 2025, the ceasefire was described in official statements as a mutual halt to all firing and military action across domains, timed to begin that evening . Such clarity matters. Clarity reduces accidental escalation. It creates a shared reference point. That is sattva in language.

## 8. The Upanishads and the dignity of the neighbor

Vedanta’s most subversive teaching in times of war is the teaching of unity.

- “Tat tvam asi,” That thou art, points to shared Self.
- “Aham brahmasmi,” I am Brahman, points to sacred consciousness.
- “Sarvam khalvidam brahma,” all this is Brahman, points to pervasiveness.

These teachings do not erase the reality of borders. They erase the moral permission to hate. They say: do not turn another human being into an object for your rage.

This matters especially in Kashmir, where communities have lived amid suspicion, militarization, and competing narratives for decades. A Vedantic lens says: if your identity is only national, you will demand endless protection. If your identity includes the Self, you can still seek safety, but you will refuse cruelty as a method.

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad offers an ethical line that can be read politically: “From the fear of That, fire burns; from the fear of That, the sun rises.” The teaching is that the cosmos has order. When human order breaks, it is because we have forgotten the deeper order of conscience.

A ceasefire is not merely a pause. It is a chance to remember order.

## 9. Grief, anger, and the psychology of crowds

Vedanta respects grief. It does not demand forced positivity. It says: let grief be felt, but do not let grief harden into hatred.

In crises like May 2025, grief tends to evolve into three public emotions:

- Anger: a desire to punish.
- Fear: a desire to control.
- Pride: a desire to prove superiority.

Each emotion has a shadow. Anger becomes cruelty. Fear becomes surveillance and collective punishment. Pride becomes humiliation of the other, which then guarantees future conflict.

Vedanta suggests a different alchemy:

- Grief becomes compassion.
- Fear becomes vigilance with restraint.
- Pride becomes dignity without contempt.

This alchemy is a form of sadhana, disciplined practice. It is not automatic. It requires leaders who model it and communities that reward it.

The Yoga Sutras again offers guidance: cultivate compassion for the suffering. In modern terms, cultivate compassion for victims on both sides. This does not excuse perpetrators. It simply refuses to extend blame to the innocent.

## 10. A Vedantic map for de escalation: principles that scale

Vedanta does not write treaties, but it offers principles that can guide treaty making. Here is a Vedanta shaped map that can support de escalation after a shock event.

### 10.1 Satya first: shared facts

Create mechanisms for joint or third party verification of major claims. When facts are shared, outrage has less fuel. When facts are not shared, rumors become weapons.

### 10.2 Ahimsa as policy: civilian protection as a non negotiable

Even in self defense, protecting civilians is a moral north star. If civilian harm becomes acceptable, the conflict becomes unlimited.

### 10.3 Aparigraha: resisting the hoarding of leverage

Aparigraha is non grasping. In diplomacy, it means: do not demand total victory as a precondition for peace. Seek enough security to live, not total domination to feel safe.

### 10.4 Tapas: discipline in communication

Tapas is disciplined heat, the strength to endure discomfort. In crisis communication, tapas means resisting inflammatory language and resisting the temptation to humiliate.

### 10.5 Kshama: forgiveness without forgetting

Forgiveness does not mean abandoning justice. It means refusing to poison the future with endless vengeance. Without some form of forgiveness, ceasefires remain only tactical.

### 10.6 Seva: visible humanitarian gestures

Humanitarian gestures create moral space for diplomacy. They also reduce the collective dehumanization that makes future violence easier.

### 10.7 Meditation: inner de escalation as outer stability

This may sound soft, but it is practical. If citizens are constantly inflamed, leaders become hostages to outrage. Inner calm in a population is a strategic asset for peace.

## 11. What the Gita teaches about strength and restraint

A common misreading of the Gita is that it glorifies war. A deeper reading shows that it glorifies clarity. The battlefield is a symbol of inner conflict. Krishna does not intoxicate Arjuna with hatred. He stabilizes him.

Three teachings are especially relevant.

1. “Yoga is skill in action.” Skill means proportionate action, not impulsive action.
2. “Equanimity is yoga,” says the Gita, “samatvam yoga ucyate.” A steady mind makes fewer catastrophic errors.
3. “The wise see the same Self in all.” This dissolves the mental permission to commit cruelty.

In the context of India and Pakistan, these teachings suggest that true strength is the ability to step back from the brink even when pride demands escalation. The ceasefire, however contested and fragile, is a sign that restraint remained possible .

## 12. Kashmir as a spiritual mirror: the cost of perpetual vigilance

Kashmir is often discussed as geography or ideology. Vedanta invites another view: Kashmir as a mirror of the human condition, where beauty and pain coexist, where sacred longing and political violence share the same landscape.

When a region lives for decades in vigilance, several spiritual costs appear:

- distrust becomes habitual
- young minds inherit trauma narratives
- ordinary life feels provisional
- the heart becomes tired

Vedanta acknowledges fatigue. It also offers renewal through the recognition of the Self, which is untouched by passing storms. This is not escapism. It is resilience. A person rooted in the witness can work for peace without being consumed by despair.

## 13. Practices for citizens: a sadhana of peace without naivete

Not everyone negotiates ceasefires, but everyone participates in the mental environment that makes ceasefires possible or impossible. Here are practical Vedantic practices that ordinary citizens can adopt after a crisis.

### 13.1 The three question pause

Before sharing crisis content, pause and ask:

- Is this verified?
- Will sharing reduce suffering or inflame hatred?
- Am I sharing to help, or to feel powerful?

This is satya plus ahimsa.

### 13.2 The compassion extension

Each day, spend one minute wishing safety for:

- victims in your own community
- victims across the border
- soldiers who fear escalation
- children who did not choose this conflict

This is maitri and karuna.

### 13.3 The anger ritual of release

Anger is energy. Do not suppress it. Offer it. Write down what you fear and what you want to protect. Then ask: what action protects without hatred?

This converts rajas into sattva.

### 13.4 Seva as antidote to helplessness

Support relief efforts, trauma counseling, or community rebuilding. Seva prevents cynicism. It also trains the mind to value healing over spectacle.

### 13.5 Meditation on the witness

Sit quietly and repeat a simple inquiry: “What is aware of this thought?” This returns you to the sakshi. From sakshi, you can engage politics without being devoured.

## 14. The meaning of a ceasefire in Vedantic terms

A ceasefire is an interruption of outward karma. It is a collective decision to stop adding fresh causes of grief. In Vedantic terms, it is a moment when sattva briefly outweighs rajas.

Yet ceasefires are fragile because the inner causes remain: mistrust, humiliation, unresolved trauma, strategic rivalry, and competing narratives. Vedanta therefore treats the ceasefire as a doorway to deeper work:

- truth telling
- justice mechanisms
- economic and cultural contact where possible
- protection of minorities and civilians
- long term dialogue frameworks

No single philosophy can solve geopolitics. But philosophy can shape the quality of mind that approaches geopolitics.

## 15. Closing: from darkness to light, from fear to peace

The Upanishads offer a prayer that fits every crisis:

“Asato ma sad gamaya; tamaso ma jyotir gamaya; mrityor ma amritam gamaya.”
Lead us from the unreal to the real, from darkness to light, from fear laden death to the deathless.

In May 2025, the subcontinent tasted darkness and then stepped back. Let that stepping back be honored. Let it also be deepened. May leaders cultivate dharma that protects without hatred. May citizens cultivate viveka that refuses misinformation. May communities cultivate ahimsa that honors every innocent life. And may Kashmir, so often reduced to a battlefield, be remembered as a home of human hearts.

Om shanti, shanti, shanti.

## 6A. Collective karma, samskara, and the memory of violence

Vedanta’s language of karma is often misunderstood as fatalism. In its classical sense, karma is simply the moral physics of cause and effect. A deed leaves a trace. A trace becomes a tendency. A tendency becomes a habit. Habits, when shared across communities, become culture. Over time, culture becomes destiny, unless awareness intervenes.

In Kashmir and along the Line of Control, decades of violence have created deep samskaras, impressions in the collective psyche. A samskara is not a verdict. It is a groove. When new tragedy strikes, the groove is reactivated. People do not only respond to the present event. They respond to the accumulated memory of previous wounds. This is why the same incident can trigger wildly different interpretations depending on inherited narratives.

Vedanta’s practical question is: how do we transform samskaras without denying suffering?

Three moves are essential:

- Naming: acknowledge pain without exaggeration or denial. Naming is satya.
- Containment: refuse revenge fantasies and collective blame. Containment is ahimsa.
- Repatterning: create repeated experiences of safety and dignity. Repatterning is new karma.

A community that can speak honestly about its scars while refusing to nurse hatred begins to loosen the samskara. This is slow work. Yet slow work is often what prevents fast catastrophes.

## 6B. The six inner enemies in geopolitics

The Bhagavad Gita calls kama and krodha powerful enemies. Later dharmic literature speaks of the shadripu, the six inner enemies: desire (kama), anger (krodha), greed (lobha), delusion (moha), pride (mada), and envy (matsarya). These are not only personal. They also operate in institutions.

Consider how each can appear in a crisis like May 2025:

- Kama: the desire for quick emotional relief through retaliation.
- Krodha: the rage that reduces complex reality to a single villain.
- Lobha: the urge to hoard leverage, territory, or political advantage.
- Moha: confusion, misinformation, and the fog of propaganda.
- Mada: pride that treats compromise as humiliation.
- Matsarya: rivalry that cannot tolerate the other’s dignity.

Vedanta’s point is not to insult nations. It is to describe a universal mechanism. When shadripu dominate, leaders become less free. They are driven, not choosing. When leaders practice inner restraint, they become more free, and their choices widen. A ceasefire is often a sign that at least one of these enemies, usually pride and anger, was temporarily restrained.

## 6C. The ethics of speech: satya, hitam, priyam

In the Taittiriya tradition, speech is governed by a triad: satya (truth), hitam (beneficial), and priyam (pleasant). Not every sentence can satisfy all three, but dharmic speech aims to avoid needless harm.

During the May 2025 crisis, statements from governments, media, and citizens carried high stakes. Words can cool a battlefield or ignite it. A Vedantic ethics of speech would recommend:

- speak facts you can support, and label uncertainty openly
- avoid triumphalism that humiliates the other side
- avoid collective blame that targets entire populations
- leave rhetorical room for de escalation so that peace does not look like surrender

This is not mere politeness. It is strategic compassion. If public language becomes dehumanizing, then any future negotiation becomes morally impossible, because the other has already been declared unworthy of dignity.

## 6D. The body of a nation: the five koshas and public fear

Vedanta describes the human being through the five koshas, or sheaths: annamaya (body), pranamaya (vital energy), manomaya (mind), vijnanamaya (discernment), and anandamaya (deep well-being). A crisis moves through these layers.

- At the annamaya level, people fear physical harm, blackouts, and displacement.
- At the pranamaya level, anxiety spreads like a contagion, tightening breath and sleep.
- At the manomaya level, stories and images loop, and anger becomes addictive.
- At the vijnanamaya level, some seek clarity and de escalation, but discernment is fragile.
- At the anandamaya level, faith traditions offer refuge in prayer and silence.

A healthy society strengthens vijnanamaya: the capacity to think clearly under stress. This is why independent verification, calm leadership, and slow journalism matter. They help a population breathe again, which then reduces pressure on leaders to escalate for symbolic reassurance.

## 6E. A note on nuclear shadow and the dharma of restraint

Vedanta does not need to know the details of deterrence theory to make a simple point: when the stakes are existential, restraint becomes sacred duty. The May 2025 crisis drew global concern partly because nuclear armed rivals were exchanging strikes and claims, raising fears of miscalculation . In such conditions, humility is not weakness. It is survival.

The Kena Upanishad warns against the arrogance that forgets the deeper power behind our powers. In modern terms: do not mistake technological capability for spiritual maturity. The more power a state holds, the more essential it is that power be governed by sattva, not by rage or pride.

## 7A. Three Vedantic lenses on the “other”: Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita

Vedanta is not a single voice. It is a family of approaches that can each illuminate conflict differently, without forcing a simplistic conclusion.

### Advaita: the other as not-other

Advaita Vedanta points toward nonduality. The deepest Self is one, and difference is a play of name and form. In a conflict, Advaita functions like a moral acid that dissolves hatred. If the same consciousness shines in every heart, then harming the innocent is not only unethical, it is self-harm. “Tat tvam asi” becomes a political ethic: do not treat any life as expendable.

Advaita does not deny the need for security. It denies the need for contempt. It insists that even defensive action must be permeated by sorrow, not by glee.

### Vishishtadvaita: unity with distinction

Vishishtadvaita sees unity, but a unity that includes real distinctions. The world and souls are not illusions; they are inseparable expressions of the Divine. In this view, the “other” is still a real person with a real story, held in the same sacred ground. Compassion becomes relational. It is easier to say: I can disagree, I can protect, yet I cannot dehumanize.

This lens supports policies that seek security while preserving dignity. It also supports humanitarian gestures because the suffering of any part of the Divine’s body is not irrelevant.

### Dvaita: devotion and moral boundaries

Dvaita Vedanta emphasizes difference between the individual soul and the Supreme. This can be powerful in public life because it preserves moral accountability. Perpetrators are not absorbed into a vague oneness that excuses evil. Justice matters. Yet devotion in Dvaita is meant to soften the heart, not harden it. The ideal devotee is humble, truthful, and compassionate.

In a conflict, this lens can support firm boundaries while still honoring the Divine in the neighbor. One may resist wrongdoing without hatred, because the ultimate allegiance is to God, not to ego.

These three lenses, taken together, offer a complete ethic: unity that dissolves hatred, distinction that preserves empathy, and devotion that grounds accountability.

## 8A. Yuddha dharma: restraint inside the reality of force

South Asian epics and dharma literature frequently insist that even when force is used, it must be restrained by rules. The Mahabharata’s ethical refrain is often summarized as “ahimsa paramo dharma,” non harming as the highest duty. The Mahabharata contains repeated discussions of yuddha dharma, the ethics of war: do not harm noncombatants, do not strike the unarmed, avoid cruelty for pleasure, and honor limits. One need not romanticize epics to appreciate their insight: unrestrained violence destroys the very goal it claims to secure.

From a Vedantic standpoint, the point of yuddha dharma is not to sanctify war. It is to prevent war from becoming demonic. When restraint collapses, tamas grows. The mind begins to enjoy domination. That enjoyment is a spiritual fall.

Therefore, even those who argue for defensive strikes must still accept a higher discipline: minimize harm, avoid escalation, and keep the door open for peace. The ceasefire in May 2025 can be read as an imperfect but meaningful act of yuddha dharma, an agreement to halt action across land, air, and sea at a set time . That kind of coordination is precisely what restraint looks like under extreme pressure.

## 9A. Loka-sangraha and diplomacy: holding the world together

Krishna speaks of loka-sangraha, the holding together of society. Diplomacy, at its best, is loka-sangraha. It is the art of making room for survival when emotions and pride are pushing toward destruction.

In May 2025, diplomacy was publicly acknowledged as central to the ceasefire, with the United States describing senior level engagement and the United Nations welcoming the agreement . International actors also condemned the initial terrorist attack and urged restraint . These statements matter because they create a shared moral frame: terrorism is unacceptable, retaliation must not become uncontrolled war, and civilians must be protected.

Diplomacy is often mocked as weakness. Vedanta sees it differently. Diplomacy is tapas. It is the disciplined willingness to endure criticism while choosing the future over the thrill of escalation.

After such crises, states often impose punitive measures such as visa restrictions, trade limits, or airspace closures, which can deepen mistrust and harden public sentiment . Some issues, such as water sharing arrangements, can become entangled with security disputes, increasing long term risk . A Vedantic posture would encourage separating humanitarian necessities from political rivalry wherever possible, because starving cooperation in essentials tends to amplify insecurity rather than reduce it.

## 10A. The “victory” problem: why narratives prolong conflict

A subtle obstacle to peace is the demand that someone must be seen to “win.” Analysts of the May 2025 crisis noted that both sides declared victory while information was contested and narratives were weaponized . This dynamic is not unique. It is an expression of mada, pride.

Vedanta offers a different definition of victory. Victory is not the humiliation of the other. Victory is the reduction of suffering. Victory is the prevention of catastrophe. Victory is the ability to stop.

From this angle, the most courageous moment in a spiral is not the first strike. It is the first pause. The pause requires confronting public anger, absorbing criticism, and risking misinterpretation. Yet the pause is often what saves lives.

If societies could celebrate restraint as strength, ceasefires would generally hold longer. If societies celebrate only domination, ceasefires become temporary.

## 11A. From ceasefire to healing: the long work of chitta-shuddhi

Chitta-shuddhi, purification of mind, is a prerequisite for knowledge in Vedanta. In collective life, chitta-shuddhi means cleansing the public sphere of dehumanization and fatalism.

After a ceasefire, chitta-shuddhi can take tangible forms:

- trauma support for affected communities
- truthful investigation of attacks and accountability for perpetrators
- protection of minorities from backlash
- programs that humanize the neighbor through cultural contact
- educational efforts that teach media literacy and critical thinking

None of this is easy. It often feels too slow compared to the speed of outrage. But Vedanta is honest: the mind changes slowly. Sustained practice is required.

Sri Ramakrishna, often cited within the Vedantic renaissance, emphasized sincerity and direct experience. Applied socially, sincerity means refusing performative peace while privately nourishing hatred. Genuine peace begins inside, then becomes policy.

Swami Vivekananda repeatedly called for strength paired with compassion. Strength without compassion becomes tyranny. Compassion without strength becomes helplessness. The balance is sattva guided rajas: energy governed by clarity.

## 12A. A short liturgy of peace for a wounded region

Vedanta does not rely only on analysis. It also offers prayer, which is a way to align the heart with dharma.

May those who mourn find support.
May those who govern find clarity.
May those who serve in uniform be protected from hatred.
May children on all sides sleep without fear.
May Kashmir be seen not as a trophy, but as a home.

And may we remember the Upanishadic prayer again, not as poetry, but as policy of the heart:
Lead us from darkness to light.
Lead us from fear to peace.
